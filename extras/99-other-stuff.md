# Other stuff to think about

This is just a dumping ground for random things I could, in principle, write about, but probably won’t.

## Planar curves

* Self-overlapping curves

## Planar maps

* PL terrains, contour trees
* Colin de Verdière matrices
* Planar rigidity
	- pseudo-triangulations
	- carpenter’s rule
* Homotopy height
* Lots of approximation and FPT algorithms

## Surface Maps

* Reeb graphs
* Curves on surfaces
	- Invariants
	- Gauss codes for lacets (via cubic Hamiltonian embedding)
	- simplification (Hass-Scott lemma)
	- selfoverlappitude
* Shortest homotopic paths on surfaces
* Normal coordinates and curve tracing
* Piecewise linear surfaces
	- Alexandrov’s convexity theorem
	- Cauchy rigidity?
	- Homotopy testing?
	- Shortest paths (continuous Dijkstra, heat equation)
* Intrinsic Delaunay triangulations
* Graph minor theory
* Lots of approximation and FPT algorithms
