# One-Dimensional Computational Topology 

These are lecture notes from a special-topics class on computational topology that I have taught several times at the University of Illinois, most recently in [Spring 2023](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/comptop/2023/).  The course focuses on algorithms for curves and graphs in the plane and on other surfaces.

I’m writing everything in Markdown, partly to focus my time on _writing_ instead of typography, and in part to make the final output more accessible by producing HTML and ePub versions.  As a result, the notes are typographically rather awkward/ugly.  Some day I will figure out how to use Pandoc templates and filters.  (Real Soon Now, Honest.) 

I drafted most of these notes in Fall 2020 and revised them in Spring 2023; a handful of chapters (13, 16, 26, 27, 29, 30) were first drafted in Spring 2023.  Most of the missing chapters either cover material I did not discussed in class, or cover material from my own research papers.  

I think I’m about 2/3 of the way to a complete draft of an actual textbook, but even the most polished notes are still **very** rough drafts.  

***You are welcome to use these notes, but I would not recommend citing them as a definitive source for ANYTHING.***

I honestly don't know when I'll be able to work on these notes again in earnest, or when (if ever) they're likely to be complete.  I'll fiddle with them a bit over the summer, but I'm going to be swamped with my real job during the academic year, especially in the fall,  I won't teach this class again until 2025 at the absolute earliest.
