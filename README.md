# One-dimensional computational topology 

These are lecture notes from a special-topics class on computational topology that I have taught several times at the University of Illinois, most recently in [Spring 2023](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/comptop/2023/).  The course focuses on algorithms for curves and graphs in the plane and on other surfaces.

I’m writing everything in Markdown, partly to focus my time on _writing_ instead of typography, and in part to make the final output more accessible by producing HTML and ePub versions.  As a result, the notes are typographically rather awkward/ugly.  Some day I will figure out how to use Pandoc templates and filters.  (Real Soon Now, Honest.) 

I drafted most of these notes in Fall 2020 and revised them in Spring 2023; a handful of chapters (13, 16, 26, 27, 29, 30) were first drafted in Spring 2023.  Most of the missing chapters either cover material I did not discussed in class, or cover material from my own research papers.  I think I’m about 2/3 of the way to a complete draft of an actual textbook, but **even the most polished notes are still VERY rough drafts***. 

***You are welcome to use these notes in your own classes, but I would not recommend citing them as a definitive source for ANYTHING.***

I plan to work on these notes sporadically over the summer, but (thanks to a heavy fall teaching load) not in earnest until Spring 2024.  Meanwhile, if you’ve somehow discovered this repo, please feel free t post issues and/or pull requests.
