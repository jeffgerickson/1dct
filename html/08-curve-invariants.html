<h1 data-number="1" id="curve-homotopy-and-curve-invariantsalpha"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Curve homotopy and curve
invariants<span class="math inline">\(^\alpha\)</span></h1>
<p><strong><em>Caveat Lector: This note is still pretty
sketchy!</em></strong></p>
<p>In an earlier lecture we argued that any generic curve in the plane
can be continuously deformed into any other by a finite sequence of
homotopy moves. But our earlier argument was unsatisfying for a number
of reasons. First, I deliberately glossed over several details; while I
claim that these details are ultimately mechanical, <em>you</em> have no
reason to believe my assessment, or even that I’ve worked out the
details at all. (I <em>have</em> worked out the details, but my mere
claim shouldn’t be enough to convince you. Proof by Old Tenured White
Dude is not a proof at all.) Second, the proof is nonconstructive.
Third, the proof gives us no idea <em>how many</em> homotopy moves are
required.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="steinitzs-contraction-algorithm"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Steinitz’s contraction
algorithm</h2>
<p>The following constructive algorithm for contracting a generic curve
via homotopy moves is implicit in Steinitz’s 1916 proof of the seminal
theorem that bears his name: A graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the 1-skeleton of a
three-dimensional convex polyhedron if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is planar and 3-connected. (I’ll
explain the connection between this algorithm and Steinitz’s theorem
later in the course.)</p>
<p>We first define some useful substructures of non-simple generic
curves. A <em>loop</em> in a curve <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a simple subpath of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> that starts and ends at the same
vertex. A <em>spindle</em> is a pair of simple, interior-disjoint
subpaths of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> with the same
distinct endpoints. A <em>vertex</em> of a spindle is an endpoint of the
subpaths of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> that defines it.
A spindle is <em>convex</em> if its interior contains exactly one corner
of each vertex. A spindle is <em>irreducible</em> if its interior does
not contain the interior of another bigon; easy case analysis implies
that every irreducible spindle is convex. A <em>monogon</em> is a face
whose boundary is a loop; a <em>bigon</em> is a face whose boundary is a
(necessarily convex) spindle.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Lemma (Steinitz):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> be a non-simple
curve with no monogons. There is at least one irreducible spindle in
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the first vertex
encountered twice when traversing <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> from an arbitrary basepoint; the
subpath of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> between the two
occurrences of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a loop. Thus,
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> contains at least one loop.
Let <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> be the loop with the
fewest faces in its interior, breaking ties arbitrarily.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>We call any maximal subpath of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> a <em>strand</em>. There must be at
least one strand, since otherwise <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> would be a monogon. The minimality
of <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> implies that each strand is
a <em>simple</em> path. Each strand in <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> forms a convex spindle with some
subpath of <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>; thus, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> contains at least one spindle. Any
spindle with the fewest faces in its interior is irreducible.</p>

<dt><strong>Lemma (Steinitz):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> be a non-simple
curve with no monogons, and let <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> be any irreducible spindle in
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. Either <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a bigon, or there is a
triangular face in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> that shares an edge with <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Again, any maximal subpath of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> a <em>strand</em>; there must be
at least one strand, since otherwise <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a bigon. Irreducibility implies
that the strands satisfy three conditions:
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Every strand is simple. (Otherwise a strand would contain a loop,
and therefore either a monogon or a smaller spindle.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Every strand has one endpoint on each subpath defining <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. (Otherwise, that strand would
form a smaller spindle with one side of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Every pair of strands intersects at most once. (Otherwise, some pair
of strands would define a smaller spindle.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Now there are two cases to consider. If no pair of strands
intersects, the faces at both vertices are triangles, each sharing
<em>two</em> edges with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.
Otherwise, imagine continuously sweeping a curve through the interior of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> from one boundary subpath to
the other, and let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the first
interior vertex that this curve sweeps over. The two strands that
intersect at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> form a triangular
face with one of the boundary curves of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With these two lemmas in hand, we can now describe Steinitz’s
algorithm. Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> be any
generic curve with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices. If
<span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span>, the curve is simple and there
is nothing to do. If <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>
contains a loop, remove it with a single <span
class="math inline">\(1\to0\)</span> move and recursively simplify the
remaining curve. Otherwise, let <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> be any irreducible spindle. We
empty <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> by repeatedly
performing <span class="math inline">\(3\to3\)</span> moves, each time
moving a triangular face from the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to the exterior. Once <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> becomes a bigon, we remove it with
a single <span class="math inline">\(2 \to 0\)</span> move, and then
recursively simplify the remaining curve.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Extracting a triangle from a spindle
(Steinitz Rademacher 1934).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the worst case, the algorithm uses <span
class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> moves to empty and remove each
irreducible spindle. Each phase of the algorithm removes either one or
two vertices. Thus, the algorithm runs through <span
class="math inline">\(\Theta(n)\)</span> phases, each with <span
class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> moves, so it makes <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> moves altogether. This analysis is
tight; Steinitz’s algorithm requires <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega(n^2)\)</span> moves in the worst case.</p>
<p>This is not the fastest contraction algorithm known; in 2016,
Hsien-Chih Chang and I described an algorithm to contract any planar
curve Hsien using only <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{3/2})\)</span>
homotopy moves; we also proved a matching <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega(n^{3/2})\)</span> worst-case upper bound.
However, unlike Steinitz’s algorithm, our faster algorithm sometimes
uses <span class="math inline">\(0\to2\)</span> moves. In 2022, Santiago
Aranguri, Hsien-Chih Chang, and Dylan Fridman finally proved that any
planar curve can be contracted using a sequence of <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^{3/2})\)</span> homotopy moves that never
increases the number of vertices; the sequence includes only <span
class="math inline">\(1\mathord\to 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2\mathord\to 0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(3\mathord\to3\)</span> moves.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="rotation-number"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Rotation number</h2>
<p>Definition: winding number oof the derivative around the origin.
Always an integer. For simple curves, either <span
class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>; equal to the winding number around
any interior point.</p>
<p>For polygons, equal to sum of exterior angles. (Studied by Meister in
the 1700s, and arguably by Bradwardine in the 1300s.)</p>
<p>Classify points with rightward tangents as <em>happy</em> or
<em>sad</em>; rotation number = #happy <span
class="math inline">\(-\)</span> #sad. [Gauss, possibly Meister]</p>
<p>Gauss: Also equal to sum of rotation numbers of Seifert circles.</p>
<p>But our usual representation doesn’t give us access to tangents or
curvature; indeed, generic curves need not have well-defined tangents.
Instead we use a combinatorial formula known to Gauss in terms of the
<em>writhe</em> of the curve. The writhe is defined as the sum over all
vertices of the sign of the <em>first</em> crossing at that vertex; we
emphasize that writhe is a function of both the curve and the basepoint.
<span class="math display">\[
    \textsf{writhe}(\gamma) = \sum_x \textsf{sgn}(x)
\]</span> To state Gauss’s formula succinctly, we also need to extend
the definition of winding number to points on the curve. We define the
winding number along an edge of the image graph as the average of the
winding numbers of its two incident faces; this is always a
half-integer. Similarly, we define the winding number of a curve around
one of its vertices as the average of the winding numbers of the four
faces incident to that vertex; this is always an integer. (Two of those
four faces may be the same face.) We specifically define <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{wind}_0(\gamma)\)</span> to be the winding
number of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> around its
basepoint.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Lemma (Gauss):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<span class="math inline">\(\textsf{rot}(\gamma) = 2 \cdot
\textsf{wind}_0(\gamma) + \textsf{writhe}(\gamma)\)</span>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Moving the basepoint through a positive crossing changes it into a
negative crossing (so the writhe decreases by <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>), but it also increases the winding
number around the basepoint by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.
(So without loss of generality, we could assume that the basepoint is on
the outer face and therefore <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{wind}_0(\gamma)= \pm 1/2\)</span>, but
this won’t be necessary.)
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Any continuous deformation of the curve that does not change the
number of vertices can only create and destroy happy and sad points in
matched pairs. (Deforming the curve also deforms its derivative, and the
deformation of the derivative that avoids the origin can only create or
destroy crossings with the positive <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis in matched positive-negative
pairs. Think in terms of homotopy moves!) So rotation number is an
<em>isotopy</em> invariant.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Now we argue by induction over any sequence of homotopy moves that
leads to a simple cycle. We assume the basepoint is far away from
whatever move we’re analyzing, so <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{wind}_0(\gamma)\)</span> doesn’t
change.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0\mathord\to 1\)</span>: If the deleted
vertex is positive, the loop is oriented counterclockwise, so the move
decreases both the rotation number and the writhe by <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Similarly, deleting a negative vertex
increases both rotation number and writhe by <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2\mathord\to 0\)</span>: The two
vertices have opposite signs, so the writhe doesn’t change. But the
number of happy and sad points doesn’t change either, so the rotation
number doesn’t change.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(3\mathord\to 3\)</span>: Nothing in the
formula changes.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Finally, we observe that the formula is trivially correct when the
curve is simple.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Would it be easier to argue by induction on the number of
vertices via oriented smoothing? By induction we have <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{rot}(\gamma) = \textsf{rot}(\gamma^-) +
\textsf{rot}(\gamma^+) = 2 \cdot \textsf{wind}_0(\gamma^-) +
\textsf{writhe}(\gamma^-) + 2 \cdot \textsf{wind}_0(\gamma^+) +
\textsf{writhe}(\gamma+)\)</span>. The smoothed vertex vanishes, but it
becomes the basepoint of one of the two constituent curves. The number
of crossings between the two constituent curves <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma^-\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma^+\)</span> is even, with exactly half
positive and half negative. So we need to relate <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{wind}_0(\gamma^+)\)</span> to the sign of
the smoothed vertex.</em></p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="regular-homotopy"><span

<p>No <span class="math inline">\(1\mathord\to 0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(0\mathord\to 1\)</span> moves. So rotation number
never changes.</p>
<p>Nowik’s algorithm: Without loss of generality the basepoint is on the
outer face. Repeat the following until the curve consists of empty
loops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a simple loop.</li>
<li>Empty the loop (two moves per interior vertex, plus one move for
each remaining interior strand)</li>
<li>Move the loop close to the basepoint</li>
<li>Boy’s trick: Cancel two adjacent loops on opposite sides.</li>
</ul>
<p>When these iterations end, either all loops are inside or all loops
are outside. We can deform one canonical curve to the other using a
linear number of moves. Altogether, the algorithm requires <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> moves to canonize a curve with
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices.</p>
<p>it follows that rotation number is a complete regular homotopy
invariant (just like winding number around a point is a homotopy
invariant in the once-punctured plane).</p>
