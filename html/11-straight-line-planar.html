<p>So far we have not assumed that planar embeddings are in any way
well-behaved geometrically; edges can be embedded as arbitrarily
pathological paths. It is not hard to prove using a compactness argument
(Similar to the simplicial approximation theorem for homotopy) that
every planar graph has a <em>piecewise-linear</em> planar embedding,
where every edge is embedded as a simple polygonal path.</p>
<p>But in fact, every <em>simple</em> planar graph has a
<em>straight-line</em> embedding, where every edge is represented by a
single straight line segment. More strongly, any planar
<em>embedding</em> is equivalent to (meaning it has the same rotation
system as) a straight-line embedding. This result was first proved
(indirectly) by Steinitz (1916), and then independently rediscovered by
Wagner (1936), [Cairns (1944)], Fáry (1948), Stein (1951), Stojaković
(1959), and Tutte (1960), so of course it’s usually called “Fáry’s
theorem”.</p>
<p>Non-simple planar graphs do not have straight-line embeddings; in any
such embedding, parallel edges would coincide and loops would degenerate
to points. But every planar map can be transformed into a simple map by
subdividing loops into cycles of length <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and parallel edges into paths of length
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. It (finally!) follows that any
generic planar curve with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
vertices is equivalent to a planar <em>polygon</em> with at most <span
class="math inline">\(3n\)</span> vertices.</p>
<p>The existence of straight-line maps for simple planar graphs finally
gives us the converse of Euler’s theorem:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every rotation system with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
vertices, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges, and <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> faces is the rotation system of a
planar map <strong>if and only if</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(n-m+f = 2\)</span>.</li>
<li>A signed Gauss code with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
symbols describes a planar curve <strong>if and only if</strong> it
induces <span class="math inline">\(n+2\)</span> faces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, all of the proofs described in this note are constructive;
in particular, they all imply linear-time algorithms to construct
straight-line embeddings from a given planar rotation system.</p>

<p>Throughout this note, we’ll consider the special case of <em>simple
triangulations</em>: simple planar maps in which every face is bounded
by three edges.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Triangulation Lemma (Fáry 1948):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>Every simple planar map can be extended to a simple triangulation by
adding edges between existing vertices.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Fix a simple planar map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with
a non-triangular face <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and let
<span class="math inline">\(w,x,y,z\)</span> be any four consecutive
vertices on the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. I
claim that we can add at least one new edge <span
class="math inline">\(wy\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(xz\)</span> inside <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> without creating any parallel edges.
The lemma follows form this claim by induction on the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_f (\deg(f)-3)\)</span>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For ease of presentation, assume <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is bounded. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> contains an edge between <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, necessarily outside <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The vertices <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> subdivide the boundary of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> into two paths, one through <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the other through <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Adding the edge <span
class="math inline">\(wy\)</span> to those paths creates two cycles.
Without loss of generality, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> lies
in the interior of the cycle <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> that
passes through <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>; as shown in
Figure 1.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Now suppose for the sake of argument that <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> also contains an edge <span
class="math inline">\(xz\)</span>, again necessarily outside <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. This edge passes through the exterior
of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> near <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, but it also passes through the
interior of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> near <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. So the Jordan Curve Theorem implies
that <span class="math inline">\(xz\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, contradicting the definition of
embedding. <span class="math inline">\(\qquad\square\)</span></p>

**Proof (Euler):**

Euler’s formula implies that $T$ has exactly $3n-6$ edges, so the _average_ vertex degree is just less than $6$.  On the other hand, if $T$ has $k$ vertices with degree less than $6$, then $T$ has _at least_ $3n - 3k/2$ edges.  The inequality $3n-3k/2 \le 3n-6$  implies $k\ge 4$.  We conclude that $T$ has at least four vertices with degree less than $6$, at least one of which is an interior vertex. -->

<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be a simple planar
triangulation with <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;3\)</span> vertices.
Every vertex of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has degree at

class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is not simple or <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has a face with degree greater than
<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Assign angle <span
class="math inline">\(\angle c = 1/3\)</span> to every corner of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, so that every face <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has discrete curvature <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa(f) = 0\)</span>. Then each vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has curvature <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa(v) = 1 - \deg(v)/6 \le 1/2\)</span>; in
particular, a vertex has positive curvature if and only if its degree is
at most <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. The combinatorial
Gauss-Bonnet theorem implies that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_v

have at least four vertices with positive curvature. At least one of
these is an interior vertex.

Every convex polygon is trivially star-shaped. Every simple

at most two reflex vertices, which are either adjacent or not. In every

non-empty; see the figure below.

We argue by induction on the number of vertices. Let <span

<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has only <span

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> be any interior vertex of

induction hypothesis implies that <span

Deleting the diagonals yields a simple planar map <span

### Separating Triangles (Fáry)

Fáry avoids using the Triangulation Lemma in the induction step as follows:

**Proof (Fáry):**
: After removing _any_ interior vertex $v$, triangulate the resulting face $f$ by joining _any_ vertex $w$ to all others.  Equivalently, choose any two bounded faces $uvw$ and $vwx$ that share an edge $vw$, and contracting $vw$ to a new vertex $v’$.  This contraction creates parallel pairs of edges $uv’$ and $v’w$; delete one edge from each pair.

: If the resulting map $\Sigma’$ is not simple, the original triangulation $T$ has a nontrivial _separating triangle_ $tvw$.  Let $T^+$ be the subgraph of $T$ obtained by deleting all vertices inside $tvw$, and let $T^-$ be the subgraph obtained by deleting all vertices outside $tvw$.  We can recursively construct straight-line triangulations $\overline{T^+}$ and $\overline{T^-}$ equivalent to $T^+$ and $T^-$.  Affinely mapping $\overline{T^-}$ into face $\overline{tvw}$ of $\overline{T^+}$ gives us a straight-line triangulation $\overline{T}$ equivalent to $T$.

: Recursion inside the inner triangulation $T^-$ implies that it is always possible to choose an edge $vw$ whose contraction yields a simple triangulation.  So we can proceed as follows:

: Choose any interior vertex $v$.  Find a neighbor $w$ of $v$ that is adjacent to only two other neighbors of $v$.  Delete $v$ and connect $w$ to all of $v$’s other neighbors, to obtain a map $\Sigma’$.  Recursively compute a straight-line map $\overline\Sigma’$.  Delete the edges from $\overline{w}$ to the other neighbors of $v$; let $f$ be the resulting $\deg(v)$-gonal face.  The kernel of $f$ includes vertex $\overline{w}$ and therefore has nonempty intersection with the interior of $f$.  Add a point $\overline{v}$ in the interior of the kernel, and Bob’s your uncle!


## Convex Polyhedral Embeddings (Stein)

Stein actually proves a stronger claim, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for embeddings with convex faces.  A planar map is _weakly convex_ if the boundary of each face, including the outer face, is a convex polygon, possibly with collinear edges.  In particular, every edge of a weakly convex map is a straight line segment.  Every weakly convex planar map satisfies two topological conditions:

- The boundary of every face is a simple cycle.
- The intersection of any two facial cycles is connected: either empty, a single vertex, or a simple path.

Any planar map satisfying these two conditions is called _weakly polyhedral_.

**Weakly Convex Embedding Theorem (Stein):** _For every weakly polyhedral planar embedding, there is an equivalent weakly convex polyhedral embedding._


**Proof [¡¡BROKEN!!]:**
: Let $\Sigma$ be a weakly polyhedral embedding.  If the underlying graph of $\Sigma$ is the complete graph $K_4$---the simplest graph with a polyhedral embedding---finding an equivalent convex embedding is straightforward, so assume otherwise.  There are two cases to consider:

: Suppose $\Sigma$ has a vertex $v$ with degree $2$.  Let $u$ and $w$ be the neighbors of $v$.  The contracted map $\Sigma / uv$ is still weakly polyhedral.  So  the induction hypothesis implies that there is a convex embedding $\overline{\Sigma'}$ equivalent to $\Sigma / uv$.  We can obtain a convex embedding $\overline{\Sigma}$ equivalent to $\Sigma$ by adding a vertex $\overline{v}$ on the edge $\overline{uw}$ in $\overline{\Sigma'}$.

: On the other hand, suppose every vertex in $\Sigma$ has degree at least $3$. I claim that there is an interior edge $e$ such that $\Sigma \setminus e$ is weakly polyhedral.

: Deleting any interior edge $e$ merges the faces $f$ and $g$ on either side of $e$  into a single face $f\cup g$.  Suppose this new face has disconnected intersection with some other face $h$; equivalently, the union $f\cup g\cup h$ is not simply connected.  Then there is a closed curve $\gamma$ that starts at an endpoint of $e$, then passes through $f$ to some vertex in $f \cap h$, then passes through $h$ to some vertex in $g\cap h$, and finally passes through $g$ back to its starting endpoint of $e$.  The interior of $\gamma$ contains at least one face of $\Sigma$.

: Deleting $uv$ merges the two shores of $u\mathord\to v$ into a new face $f$.  The the inductive hypothesis implies that there is an equivalent convex embedding $\overline{\Sigma \setminus uv}$.  We can obtain a convex embedding $\overline{\Sigma}$ equivalent to $\Sigma$ by adding the line segment $\overline{uv}$ through the convex face $\overline{f}$ in $\overline{\Sigma'}$.  $\qquad\square$


![Two weakly convex embeddings of the cube graph obtained by Stein's algorithm.](Fig/cube-convex){ width=40% }

With a bit more effort, Stein's argument can be extended to show that every _strictly_ polyhedral embedding (where two faces intersect in at most one edge) is equivalent to a _strictly_ convex embedding (where no two edges of any face are collinear).  But we'll see a more interesting proof of that fact in the next lecture.

<p>Here is a second inductive proof of the Straight-Line Triangulation
Theorem that does <em>not</em> rely on Euler’s formula, roughly
following an argument of de Fraysseix, Pach, and Pollack (1988). This
proof is close in spirit to early flawed inductive proofs of Euler’s
formula, including Euler’s own flawed proof.</p>
<p>We actually prove the following stronger claim: Let <span

<p>The second case is actually redundant. A simple recursive argument,

<p>In 1989, Walter Schnyder discovered a significant refinement of the
previous proof, which implies that any <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-vertex planar graph has a straight-line
embedding whose vertices lie on an <span
class="math inline">\((n-1)\times (n-1)\)</span> integer grid. Again, we
consider only simple planar <em>triangulations</em>, where all faces
have degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, including the outer
face.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be a simple planar
triangulation with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices.
Schnyder defined two different ways to annotate features of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with the colors red, green, and blue.
The first of these is a <em>Schnyder coloring</em>, which colors the
interior corners subject to two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The corners of each face are colored red, green, and blue in
counterclockwise order.</li>
<li>The corners around each internal vertex are colored red, then green,
then blue in counterclockwise order. In particular, each internal vertex
is incident to at least one corner of each color.</li>
</ul>

alt="A Schnyder coloring of a simple triangulation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A Schnyder coloring of a simple
triangulation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A Schnyder coloring can be constructed in linear time as follows.
Color the outer vertices of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> red,
green, and blue in counterclockwise order. If <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has a single bounded face, its three
corners inherit the colors of the incident vertices. Otherwise, choose
an arbitrary edge from a boundary vertex <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to an interior vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. There are two cases to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has exactly two
common neighbors with <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The
contraction <span class="math inline">\(T/uv\)</span> has two pairs of
parallel edges; deleting one edge in each pair yields a smaller
triangulation <span class="math inline">\(T’\)</span>. Recursively
compute a Schnyder coloring for <span class="math inline">\(T’\)</span>,
and transfer the corner colors back to <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Finally, there is only one way to
consistently color the faces of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>
on either side of <span class="math inline">\(uv\)</span>; specifically,
the corners incident to the boundary vertex <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> inherit <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>’s color.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has at least three
common neighbors with <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, there must
be a triangle <span class="math inline">\(uvw\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> containing at least one vertex in its
interior. In this case, we recursively compute Schnyder colorings of the
subgraphs of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> inside <span
class="math inline">\(uvw\)</span> and outside <span
class="math inline">\(uvw\)</span>. In both recursive subproblems the
boundary vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> retains its
originally assigned color, so that the resulting Schnyder colorings are
compatible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the second case is unnecessary. By expanding the recursion
from the second case, we see that the entire construction is carried out
by a sequence of contractions; equivalently, an easy induction argument
implies that at least one edge from each boundary vertex can be
contracted immediately. The Schnyder coloring in the figure above was
computed by contacting the interior vertices toward the top (green)
vertex in the order indicated by the vertex labels.</p>

<p>The second annotation, called a <em>Schnyder wood</em>, assigns a
direction and a color to every internal edge of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Every internal edge in <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is incident to corners with all three
colors, with one color appearing twice at one endpoint. Schnyder orients
each internal edge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> toward the
endpoint with the same color twice, and assigns the repeated color to
the edge. The resulting coloring and orientation has the following
useful properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each boundary vertex has only incoming internal edges, all with the
same color as the vertex itself.</li>
<li>Every internal vertex has exactly one outgoing edge of each
color.</li>
<li>At every internal vertex, incident edges appear in counterclockwise
order as follows: one outgoing red, all incoming blue, one outgoing
green, all incoming red, one outgoing blue, all incoming green.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>We can also construct Schnyder woods directly using a sequence of
edge contractions, just as we constructed Schnyder colorings. Expanding
an edge introduces one vertex and three edges; we orient the new edges
away from the new vertex, and assign them the only colors consistent
with the properties listed above. Conversely, <em>every</em> Schnyder
wood can be constructed using this algorithm, contracting toward any of
the outer vertices.</p>

<p>Given any Schnyder wood, we can define an equivalent Schnyder
coloring as follows. For any interior corner, if the two edges are both
leaving the corner vertex, assign the third color to the corner;
otherwise, assign the color of the incoming edge(s) to the corner.</p>

<em>In any Schnyder wood, the edges of each color induce a spanning tree
of the internal vertices, rooted at the boundary vertex with that
color.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Without loss of generality, assume the Schnyder wood is constructed by
repeatedly contracting to the green boundary vertex. Each interior
vertex has exactly one outgoing edge of each color, either leading to
another interior vertex or the boundary vertex of that color.
</dd>

<p>Number the interior vertices by the order in which they are
contracted to the green boundary vertex, as shown in the figures. Label
the green boundary vertex <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the

<em>increasing</em> if the label of <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is larger than the label of <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <em>decreasing</em> otherwise.
Every green edge is decreasing, and every red and blue edge is
increasing. Thus, none of the red, green, or blue subgraphs contains a
cycle; starting from any interior node, following edges of any fixed
color leads to the outer vertex of that color. <span

<p>Now we assign integer coordinates to every interior vertex <span

red edges, a unique path of green edges, and a unique path of blue edges
from <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to the boundary. These three
paths partition the triangulation into three regions, which we color
red, green, and blue as shown below. Each region contains its clockwise
bounding path—for example, the green region includes the blue path,
including the blue boundary vertex—but not <span

<p>For purposes of defining these regions when <span
