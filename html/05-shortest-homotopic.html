class="header-section-number">1</span> Shortest (Homotopic) Paths<span
class="math inline">\(^\beta\)</span></h1>
<p>In this lecture, we’ll consider a problem that combines both geometry
and topology that arises in VLSI design (or at least <em>did</em> arise
in VLSI design in the 1980s). Suppose we have an environment <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that can be modeled as a <em>polygon
with holes</em>; this is the area bounded between a simple outer polygon
<span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and several disjoint simple
polygons or “holes” <span class="math inline">\(P_1, P_2, \dots,
P_h\)</span>, each of which lies in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. (Yes, previously we used “polygon”
to refer to the boundary, and now we’re using “polygon with holes” to
refer to the area. Welcome to mathematical jargon.)</p>
<p>We are also given a polygonal path <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in the interior of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Recall that two <em>paths</em> are
homotopic if one can be continuously deformed to the other within <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> while keeping both endpoints fixed at
all times. Our problem is to find the shortest path (that is, the path
of minimum Euclidean length) that is homotopic in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the given path <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>Although we could reduce to our earlier notion of homotopy by using
the vertices of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as point
obstacles, the pictures will be nicer (and the algorithms arguably
simpler) if we use <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> itself as our
underlying space. Our earlier formal definition of homotopy extends
directly to this setting: A homotopy between two paths <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a continuous function <span
class="math inline">\(h\colon[0,1]\times[0,1]\to X\)</span> such that
the restrictions <span class="math inline">\(h(\cdot,0)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(h(\cdot,1)\)</span> are constant functions,
and the restrictions <span class="math inline">\(h(0,\cdot)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(h(1, \cdot)\)</span> are the paths <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
denotes the number of vertices of the environment <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> denotes the number of vertices in the
input path <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. (Yes, this is
reversed from the previous lecture.) Let <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> (“source”) and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (“target”) denote the first and last
vertices of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="shortest-paths-in-simple-polygons"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Shortest Paths in Simple
Polygons</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the topologically trivial case where <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the interior of a simple polygon
with no holes. A strengthening of the Jordan Curve Theorem due to
Schönflies implies that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is
homeomorphic to an open circular disk. It follows that any two paths in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with the same endpoints are
homotopic. Thus, we are now looking for the globally shortest path in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> between the endpoints of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>The shortest path between two points <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in a simple polygon <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is a polygonal chain, whose interior
vertices lie at concave vertices of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Imagine a taut rubber band between
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>; the rubber band will be straight
everywhere, except at concave corners that it must wrap around.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The shortest path between two points in a
simple polygon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ll describe an algorithm for this special case <em>as through</em>
the topology of the problem were non-trivial; in particular, even though
the output depends only on the endpoints of the input path <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, I will still use the entire input
path to guide the algorithm.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="triangulations-and-dual-graphs"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Triangulations and Dual
Graphs</h2>
<p>The first step of our shortest-path algorithm is to triangulate the
polygon <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. We saw an algorithm in
the first lecture that computes a frugal triangulation of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log
n)\)</span> time.</p>
<p>The <em>(weak) dual graph</em> of a polygon triangulation has a
vertex for each triangle and an edge for each diagonal; two vertices are
connected by an edge in the dual graph if and only if the corresponding
triangles share a diagonal. We can draw the dual graph by placing each
vertex at the centroid of its triangle, and drawing each edge as a
polygonal path through the midpoint of the corresponding diagonal.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Lemma:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>The dual graph of any frugal triangulation of a polygon without
holes is a tree.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Suppose to the contrary that the dual graph contains a cycle <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. The image of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in our drawing is a simple polygon,
which I’ll also call <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> (at the risk
of confusing the reader). Any diagonal <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> whose dual edge is in <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> crosses <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> exactly once at the midpoint of <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. It follows that one endpoint of <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is inside <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the other endpoint is outside. So
the Jordan curve theorem implies that the polygon <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> intersects <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. But that’s impossible, because <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> does not intersect the dual graph.

<h2 data-number="1.3" id="crossing-sequences"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Crossing Sequences</h2>
<p>Next we apply the same strategy that we previously used to test
contractibility. We compute the <em>crossing sequence</em> of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and then <em>reduce</em> it as much
as possible. (Two paths are homotopic if and only if they have identical
reduced crossing sequences.) In this setting, the crossing sequence is
the sequence of diagonals crossed by <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, in order along <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A path with crossing sequence
<code>ABCDDDEFHLKJJKLMNUUTSRQPPQQOOQRSTUVWWWXYYXXYZ</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In our earlier homotopy-testing algorithm, we also recorded the
<em>sign</em> of each crossing, but that information is actually
redundant in our current setting. Recall from our proof of the polygon
triangulation theorem that any interior diagonal partitions the interior
of a polygon into two disjoint subsets. Thus, if <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> crosses the same diagonal multiple
times, those crossings must alternate between positive and negative. It
also follows that we can reduce the crossing sequence by removing
arbitrary adjacent pairs of <em>equal</em> symbols; for any such pair,
the corresponding crossings have opposite signs. For example, the
crossing sequence
<code>ABCDDDEFHLKJJKLMNUUTSRQPPQQOOQRSTUVWWWXYYXXYZ</code> of the path
in the previous figure reduces to <code>ABCDEFHMNUVWXYZ</code>.</p>
<p>We can compute the crossing sequence of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(n +
k + x)\)</span> time, where <span class="math inline">\(x =
O(kn)\)</span> is the length of the crossing sequence. Specifically, we
find the triangle containing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> by
brute force; then we can repeatedly find the next crossing (if any)
along the current edge of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time. Finally, we can reduce
the crossing sequence in <span class="math inline">\(O(x)\)</span> time
using left-greedy cancellation.</p>
<p>(The reduced crossing sequence of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> contains precisely the edge labels
that appear an odd number of times in the unreduced crossing sequence;
moreover, these labels appear in the same order as their first (or last)
occurrences in the unreduced crossing sequence.)</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="sleeves"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Sleeves</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> denote the length of
the reduced crossing sequence. The reduced crossing sequence defines a
sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}+1\)</span> triangles in
the triangulation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, starting
with the triangle containing the first vertex <span
class="math inline">\(\pi_0\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, and ending with the triangle
containing the last vertex <span class="math inline">\(\pi_k\)</span> of
<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. The union of these triangles
is called the <em>sleeve</em> of the reduced crossing sequence.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Fig/polygon-sleeve.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="The sleeve of the reduced crossing sequence ABCDEFHMNUVWXYZ" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The sleeve of the reduced crossing
sequence <code>ABCDEFHMNUVWXYZ</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Any path <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> that leaves the sleeve must cross a
diagonal <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> on the boundary of the
sleeve. The endpoints <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> lie in the same component of <span
class="math inline">\(X\setminus d\)</span>, so the path must cross
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and even number of times. Let
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> be the first and last intersection
points along <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. The line
segment <span class="math inline">\(pq\)</span> is shorter than the
subpath of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> cannot be a shortest path.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the crossing sequence describes a walk in the dual
graph of the triangulation, starting at the vertex dual to the triangle
containing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Reducing the crossing
sequence removes <em>spurs</em> from this walk—subpaths that consist of
the same edge twice in a row, necessarily in opposite directions. Thus,
the <em>reduced</em> crossing sequence describes a <em>shortest</em>
walk—in fact, the unique simple path between its endpoints—in the dual
graph. This path is also the dual graph of the induced triangulation of
the sleeve.</p>
<p>Note that we do not actually need to <em>construct</em> the sleeve;
the sequence of diagonals that the funnel crosses is exactly the reduced
crossing sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.5" id="growing-funnels"><span
class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Growing Funnels</h2>
<p>To compute the actual shortest path from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we use an algorithm independently
discovered by Tompa (1981), Chazelle (1982), Lee and Preparata (1984),
and Leiserson and Maley (1985). (My presentation most closely follows
Lee and Preparata’s.) The <em>funnel</em> of any diagonal <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the sleeve is the union of the
shortest paths the from the source point <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to all points on <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<p>The funnel consists of a polygonal path, called the <em>tail</em>,
from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to a point a called the
<em>apex</em>, plus a simple polygon called the <em>fan</em>. The tail
may be empty, in which case <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is
the apex. The fan is bounded by the diagonal <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and two concave chains joining the apex
to the endpoints of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. The shortest
path from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to either endpoint of
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> consists of the tail plus one of
the concave chains bounding the fan. Extending the edges of the concave
chains to infinite rays defines a series of <em>wedges</em>, which
subdivide both the fan and the triangle just beyond <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Fig/funnel.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="A typical funnel" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A typical funnel</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Beginning with a single triangle joining <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to the first edge in the reduced
crossing sequence, we extend the funnel through the entire sleeve one
diagonal at a time. Each diagonal in the sleeve shares one endpoint with
the previous diagonal; suppose we are extending the funnel from diagonal
<span class="math inline">\(pq\)</span> to diagonal <span
class="math inline">\(qr\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(o\)</span> be the predecessor of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the shortest path from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are two cases to consider, depending on whether <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> lie on the same sides of the line
through <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> or on opposite sides. We can actually
detect this case in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time with
a single orientation test.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> lie on opposite sides of line <span
class="math inline">\(op\)</span>, then the new endpoint <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> does not lie inside any wedge of the
current fan. We can detect this case in <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time with a single orientation test,
and then extend the tunnel in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>
time by inserting <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> as a new fan
vertex.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Fig/funnel-expand.png" style="width:85.0%"

<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> lie on the same side of line <span
class="math inline">\(op\)</span>, we <em>contract</em> the funnel,
intuitively by moving <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
continuously along the boundary edge <span
class="math inline">\(pr\)</span>. Each time the moving point crosses
the boundary of a wedge, we remove a vertex from the fan. If the removed
vertex is the apex, the next vertex on that side of the fan (on the
shortest path from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>) becomes the new apex. We can detect
whether the moving point will cross any wedge boundary in <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time using our standard orientation
test. Thus, the total time in this case is <span
class="math inline">\(O(\delta + 1)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the number of vertices deleted
from the fan. The total number of deleted vertices cannot exceed the
total number of previously inserted vertices, so the <em>amortized</em>
time for this case is also <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>.</li>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(yz\)</span> be the last diagonal in
the reduced crossing sequence. To end the algorithm, we treat the line
segment <span class="math inline">\(tz\)</span> as another diagonal and
extend the funnel one more time. The shortest path homotopic to <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> then consists of the tail of the
funnel plus the concave chain of the fan containing <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>; we can extract this shortest path in
<span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time per edge.</p>
<p>Summing up, we spend <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log n)\)</span>
time triangulating <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then <span

<em>Given a polygonal path <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in a
simple polygon <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <strong>with
holes</strong>, we can compute the shortest path in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> homotopic to <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log n + nk)\)</span> time.</em>

<p>Same algorithm, same running time, same everything. This strikes many
people as counterintuitive. After all, the sleeve can runs through the
same triangle multiple times, and the funnel can self-intersect; why
doesn’t this cause any problems?</p>
<p>One way to answer this question is that <em>the algorithm doesn’t
look for self-intersections, so it’s behavior can’t be affected by
them</em>. Or said differently: <em>the algorithm only makes local
decisions, but self-intersection is a global property</em>. Every branch
in our algorithm is based on either a comparison between two <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinates or an orientation test on
some triple of points. As far as the algorithm is concerned, every time
the funnel enters a triangle, it is entering that triangle for the very
first time, or equivalently, it is entering a <em>new copy</em> of that
triangle. So the sleeve of the reduced crossing sequence, while not
being <em>geometrically</em> a triangulated simple polygon, is still
<em>topologically</em> a triangulated simple polygon: a collection of
triangles glued together along common edges into a topological disk.</p>

<p>There is a reasonable analogy here with classical graph traversal
algorithms: depth-first search, breadth-first search, and their more
complex descendants. All of these algorithms maintain a set of vertices;
at each iteration, each algorithm pulls one vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> out of this set, <em>marks</em> that
vertex, and then puts the <em>unmarked</em> neighbors of <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> into the set. Without the marking
logic, unless the input graph is a tree, these algorithms will visit at
least one vertex infinitely many times, each time treating it as a
brand-new vertex.</p>
<p>In fact, even the original shortest-path algorithm does not actually
require the environment <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to be a
simple polygon. We only require that (1) <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is assembled from <em>any</em> set of
Euclidean triangles by identifying disjoint pairs of equal-length edges,
(2) all triangle vertices are on the boundary of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and (3) the dual graph of the
triangulation is a tree (equivalently, <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is homeomorphic to a disk in the
plane). More generally, the shortest-homotopic-path algorithm applies to
any triangulated space satisfying conditions (1) and (2); these spaces
can reasonably be called <em>boundary-triangulated flat surfaces</em>.
For example, without modification, our algorithm can compute shortest
homotopic paths on a triangulated Möbius band.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.7" id="the-universal-cover"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7</span> The Universal Cover</h2>
<p>Another explanation that may be more familiar to topologists is that
our algorithm is effectively exploring the <em>universal cover</em> of
the input polygon. Informally, the universal cover (of <em>universal
covering space</em>) of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the
infinite topological space constructed by a breadth-first search of
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <em>without memory</em>.</p>
<p>We can define the universal cover more constructively in terms of a
triangulation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as follows. Fix
a starting point <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. For every
reduced crossing sequence <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> of a
path starting at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_w\)</span> denote <em>an independent
copy</em> of the triangle containing the final point in that path. For
example, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_\varepsilon\)</span> is a
copy of the triangle containing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.
Two triangles <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_x\)</span> are <em>neighbors</em> if <span
class="math inline">\(x = wd\)</span> for some diagonal <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>; glue every such pair together along
their copies of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For example, if
<span class="math inline">\(w =\)</span> <code>ABCB</code> and <span
class="math inline">\(x =\)</span> <code>ABCBD</code>, then we would
identify the copies of edge <code>D</code> in <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_x\)</span>. We call each triangle <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_w\)</span> a <em>lift</em> of the
corresponding triangle in the triangulation of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and we call the original triangle a
<em>projection</em> of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_w\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Figure! Polygonal annulus to infinite polygonal parking

<p>The dual graph of the universal cover of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>—or equivalently, the universal cover of
the dual graph of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>—has a vertex
for every possible reduced crossing sequence (of a path starting at
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>), and an edge between two reduced
crossing sequences if they differ by exactly one crossing. Unless the
input polygon <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has no holes, the
universal cover of the dual graph is an infinite tree. The crossing
sequence describes a walk from some vertex <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{s}\)</span> to another vertex <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{t}\)</span> in this infinite tree; removing
all spurs computes the <em>unique</em> path in that tree between <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{s}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{t}\)</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.8" id="covering-spaces"><span
class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Covering Spaces</h2>
<p>The universal cover is an example of a <em>covering space</em>. We
will see several other examples of covering spaces in this course, so
let me start here with some formal definitions.</p>
<p>A <em>covering map</em> is a continuous surjective function <span
class="math inline">\(p\colon \widehat{X}\to X\)</span>, such that every
point <span class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span> has an open
neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> whose preimage <span
class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(U)\)</span> is the disjoint union of open
sets <span class="math inline">\(\bigsqcup_{i\in I} U_i\)</span>, such
that the restriction of the function <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to each open set <span
class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is a homeomorphism to <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. The open sets <span
class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> are sometimes called <em>sheets</em>
over <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. If there is a covering map
from <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{X}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, we call <span
class="math inline">\(\widehat{X}\)</span> a <em>covering space</em> of
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. By convention, we require
covering spaces to be connected.</p>
<p>The <em>universal</em> covering space <span
class="math inline">\(\widetilde{X}\)</span> can be defined in several
different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{X}\)</span> is the unique
covering space of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that also
covers every covering space of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{X}\)</span> is the unique
<em>simply-connected</em> covering space of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. (Recall that a space is <em>simply
connected</em> if every closed curve in that space is
contractible.)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{X}\)</span> is the space
of all <em>homotopy classes</em> of paths from some fixed basepoint
<span class="math inline">\(s\in X\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[
  \widetilde{X} := \big\{ [\pi] \bigm| \pi\colon [0,1]\to X \text{~and~}
\pi(0) = s \big\}
\]</span> The covering map <span class="math inline">\(p\colon
\widetilde{X}\to X\)</span> maps each homotopy class <span
class="math inline">\([\pi]\)</span> of paths to their common final
endpoint <span class="math inline">\(\pi(1)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In our construction by gluing labeled triangles, the covering map
sends each triangle <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_w\)</span> to the
corresponding triangle in the triangulation of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
