<h1 data-number="1" id="homotopy-testing-on-surface-mapsbeta"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Homotopy Testing on Surface
Maps<span class="math inline">\(^\beta\)</span></h1>
<p>Let’s return to one of the earliest problems we saw this semester:
Given two curves in the same surface, decide whether they are
<em>homotopic</em>, meaning one can be continuously deformed into the
other. Here I’ll describe a linear-time algorithm that slightly improves
a classical algorithm of Max Dehn (1911).</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I’ll focus on the following special case:
Given a <em>closed</em> curve <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in some surface <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, is <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> <em>contractible</em> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>? That is, can <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> be continuously deformed on the
surface <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> to a single
point?</p>
<p>This question is obviously trivial in the plane or the sphere, and it
turns out to be easy on the projective plane, torus, or Klein bottle, so
without loss of generality, I will assume that the underlying surface
has negative Euler characteristic <span
class="math inline">\(\chi&lt;0\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{g} = 2-\chi\)</span> denote the <em>Euler
genus</em> of the input surface; recall that the Euler genus is equal to
the standard genus if the surface is non-orientable, and twice the
standard genus otherwise.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="reducing-to-a-system-of-loops"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Reducing to a System of
Loops</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> be a given closed walk
through some surface map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.
Like every other surface-map algorithm, we begin by computing an
arbitrary tree-cotree decomposition <span class="math inline">\((T, L,
C)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. We then
reduce <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> to a system of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span> loops <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda = \Sigma \mathbin / T \setminus C\)</span>
by contracting every edge in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and
then deleting every edge in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.
simultaneously modifying the closed walk <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When we contract edges in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>,
we simply remove any darts of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>
from <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. After all edges in <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are contracted, all remaining edges are
loops.</p></li>
<li><p>Then when we delete edges in <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, we replace each dart in <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> whose edge is in <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> with a walk around the boundary of the
unique face of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, as shown in
the figure below.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Fig/sysloops-reduction.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Reducing to a system of loops." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Reducing to a system of
loops.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The reduction takes <span class="math inline">\(O(n + \ell’) = O(n +
\bar{g}\ell)\)</span> time to compute, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the complexity of the input map
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the length of the input walk
<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\ell’\)</span> is the length of the transformed
walk <span class="math inline">\(W’\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. (Later I’ll remove the factor of
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span> by reducing to a slightly
different map.)</p>
<p>We have now reached the special case of the homotopy problem that
Dehn actually solved in 1911: Given a closed walk in a system of loops,
is there a sequence of spur and face moves that reduce it to a trivial
walk?</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="universal-cover"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Universal Cover</h2>
<p>The <em>universal cover <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde\Lambda\)</span></em> of <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is an infinite planar map
obtained by gluing an infinite lattice of copies of the single face of
<span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> along corresponding edges.
Combinatorially, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde\Lambda\)</span> is
isomorphic to a regular tiling of the <em>hyperbolic</em> plane by
regular <span class="math inline">\(2\bar{g}\)</span>-gons meeting <span
class="math inline">\(2\bar{g}\)</span> at each vertex. For example, if
the input map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is an
orientable map with genus <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and
therefore Euler genus <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, we reduce
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> to a system of loops <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> containing four loops. The
universal cover <span class="math inline">\(\tilde\Lambda\)</span> of
<span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is an <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>-regular hyperbolic tiling by
octagons.</p>

<p>Formally, a <em>covering map</em> is a continuous surjection <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\colon X’\to X\)</span> between topological
spaces, such that each point <span class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span>
lies in an open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\subset
X\)</span> whose preimage <span
class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(U)\)</span> is the disjoint union of open
sets <span class="math inline">\(\bigsqcup_{i\in I} U_i\)</span>, where
the restriction of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to each set
<span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is a homeomorphism to <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Space <span
class="math inline">\(X&#39;\)</span> is called a <em>covering
space</em> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> if there is a
covering map from <span class="math inline">\(X&#39;\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. By convention, covering spaces are
assumed to be connected.</p>
<p>Covering maps can also be formulated combinatorially as follows. A
<em>map-covering map</em> is a surjective function <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\colon \Sigma’\to\Sigma\)</span> between
<em>surface maps</em> that sends vertices to vertices, darts to darts,
and faces to faces, and that preserves degrees of vertices and faces.
For example, if the maps <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma’\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> are represented rotation
systems <span class="math inline">\((D’, \textsf{rev}’,
\textsf{succ}’)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((D,
\textsf{rev}, \textsf{succ})\)</span>, a covering map is a function
<span class="math inline">\(\pi\colon D’\to D\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{rev}\circ \pi = \pi\circ
\textsf{rev}’\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{succ}\circ \pi = \pi\circ
\textsf{succ}’\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>
sends every orbit of <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{succ}’\)</span>
or <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{rev}’(\textsf{succ})’\)</span>
<em>bijectively</em> to an orbit of <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{succ}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{rev}(\textsf{succ})\)</span>,
respectively. There is a similar combinatorial formulation for
reflection systems.</p>
<p>A <em>lift</em> of any vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>
of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> to a covering space <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma’\)</span> is a vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v’\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma’\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\pi(v’)=v\)</span>. Lifts of darts, edges, and
faces are defined similarly. Locally, it is impossible to distinguish
between a feature of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and any
of its lifts in <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma’\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>universal cover</em> of a space <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the unique (connected) covering
space <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> that is
<em>simply</em> connected, meaning all closed curves are contractible.
The universal cover <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> is
also the “largest” (connected) covering space of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, meaning <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> is a covering space of every
(connected) covering space of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.
For almost all surfaces, the universal cover is homeomorphic to the
plane. (The only exceptions are the sphere, which is its own universal
cover, and the projective plane, whose universal cover is the sphere.)
Similarly, universal cover of any surface <em>map</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is a spherical map if <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> lies on the sphere or the
projective plane, and an <em>infinite</em> planar map otherwise.</p>

<dt><strong>Lemma:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>A closed walk <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> in a surface
map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is contractible if and
only if <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the projection of a
closed walk <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}\)</span> in the
universal cover <span class="math inline">\(\tilde\Sigma\)</span>.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi\colon\tilde\Sigma\to\Sigma\)</span>
denote the universal covering map.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>First, let <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}\)</span> be any
closed walk in <span class="math inline">\(\tilde\Sigma\)</span>, and
let <span class="math inline">\(W = \pi(\tilde{W})\)</span>. Because
<span class="math inline">\(\tilde\Sigma\)</span> is simply connected,
<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}\)</span> must be contractible.
Consider any sequence of spur moves and face moves <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_0 \to \tilde{W}_1 \to \tilde{W}_2 \to
\cdots \to \tilde{W}_N\)</span> that reduces <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W} = \tilde{W}_0\)</span> to a trivial
closed walk <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_N\)</span>. For each
index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(W_i = \pi(\tilde{W}_i)\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(W_0 \to W_1 \to W_2 \to \cdots \to W_N\)</span> is
also a sequence of spur moves and face moves that reduces <span
class="math inline">\(W = W_0\)</span> to a trivial walk <span
class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span>. Specifically, if <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_{i-1}\to \tilde{W}_i\)</span> is a spur
move on some edge <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{e}\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\({W}_{i-1}\to {W}_i\)</span> is a spur move
on the edge <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\tilde{e})\)</span>, and if
<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_{i-1}\to \tilde{W}_i\)</span> is a
face move on some edge <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span>,
then <span class="math inline">\({W}_{i-1}\to {W}_i\)</span> is a face
move on the edge <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\tilde{f})\)</span>. We
conclude that <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is
contractible.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Conversely, let <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> be
<em>any</em> closed walk in <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.
Formally, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is an alternating
sequence <span class="math inline">\(v_0, d_1, v_1, d_2, \dots, d_\ell,
v_\ell\)</span> of vertices and darts, where <span
class="math inline">\(v_\ell = v_0\)</span> and for each index <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(v_{i-1} = \textsf{tail}(d_i)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_i = \textsf{head}(d_i)\)</span>. We can
iteratively lift <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> to a (not
necessarily closed) walk <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}\)</span>
as follows. First, let <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_0\)</span>
be any lift of <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>, and then for
each index <span class="math inline">\(i&gt;0\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{d}_i\)</span> be the unique lift of <span
class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span> whose tail is <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_{i-1}\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_i =
\textsf{head}(\tilde{d}_i)\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is contractible.
Then there is a sequence <span class="math inline">\(W_0 \to W_1 \to W_2
\to \cdots \to W_N\)</span> of spur and face moves transforming some
trivial walk <span class="math inline">\(W_0\)</span> into <span
class="math inline">\(W_N = W\)</span>. (Yes, we are expanding here
rather than contracting.) Fix an arbitrary lift <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_0\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(W_0\)</span>. Then for each index <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_j\)</span> be the closed walk in <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> obtained from <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_{j-1}\)</span> by lifting the move <span
class="math inline">\(W_{j-1}\to W_j\)</span>. Specifically, if <span
class="math inline">\(W_{j-1}\to W_j\)</span> inserts a spur <span
class="math inline">\(v_i\mathord\to w\mathord\to v_i\)</span> into
<span class="math inline">\(W_{j-1}\)</span> at its <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_j\)</span> is obtained by inserting a
spur <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_i\mathord\to
\tilde{w}\mathord\to \tilde{v}_i\)</span> into <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_{j-1}\)</span> at its <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th vertex <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_i\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_i\mathord\to \tilde{w}\)</span> is the
unique lift of dart <span class="math inline">\(v_i\mathord\to
w\)</span> whose tail is <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{v}_i\)</span>. Face moves can be lifted
similarly. By induction, each of the resulting walks <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_j\)</span> is closed, and therefore the
final walk <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{W}_N\)</span> is a closed
walk such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\tilde{W}_N) =
W\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\qquad\square\)</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With this lemma in hand, we can now phrase the contractibility
problem in the form that Dehn’ considered it. <em>Given a closed walk
<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> in some system of loops <span

<em>Every nontrivial contractible closed walk <span

<p>Finally, Dehn’s algorithm uses a simple greedy improvement strategy:
Repeatedly remove spurs (using spur moves) and long boundary subpaths
(using face moves) from <span class="math inline">\(W’\)</span> until no
more remain, and then return <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{true}\)</span> if and only if the
remaining walk is trivial. Correctness follows immediately from Dehn’s
lemma.</p>
<p>To find long boundary subpaths efficiently, we assign a unique label
to each dart and represent <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> as a
(circular) string of dart labels, sorted in a circular linked list. Then
we slide a window of length <span
class="math inline">\(2\bar{g}-2\)</span> over the string, checking each
of the <span class="math inline">\(O(\bar{g})\)</span> possible long
boundary subpaths at each position. Using brute force string
comparisons, this check takes <span
class="math inline">\(O(\bar{g}^2)\)</span> time per position. We can
improve this to <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time per
position by building a DFA that matches all long boundary subpaths;
building this DFA adds <span class="math inline">\(O(\bar{g}^2)\)</span>
time to preprocessing.</p>
<p>Whenever we find a long boundary subpath, we replace it with its
complement (of length <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) and move
the window back <span class="math inline">\(2\bar{g}\)</span> steps; we
charge both the deletion and the time to find the long boundary subpath
to the decrease in string length. Similarly, whenever we notice a spur,
we can remove it in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time. The
algorithm ends after <span class="math inline">\(O(\ell’)\)</span>
iterations.</p>
<p>Thus, the overall running time of Dehn’s algorithm, starting with an
arbitrary surface map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with
complexity <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and Euler genus <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>, is <span

<p>To remove the dependence on <span

<p>For any surface map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = (V, E,

<p>Dehn’s lemma still applies to the infinite hyperbolic tiling <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{Q}\)</span>—Every closed walk in <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{Q}\)</span> contains either a spur of a
subpath that covers all but two edges of some face. But now the
complement of a “long” boundary subpath also has length <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>; a single face move does not
necessarily decrease the length of the walk. We need to find larger
moves that are still simple enough to find and execute quickly, but that
are guaranteed to shrink any closed walk.</p>
<p>To make this easier, we encode the walk <span
class="math inline">\(W’\)</span> as a <em>turn sequence</em>. The
<em>turn</em> of any subwalk <span class="math inline">\(u\mathord\to
v\mathord\to w\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the
number of corners at the middle vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to the left of that subpath, modulo
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>. Thus, for example, a
<em>spur</em> is any subpath of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>
with turn <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. The regularity of the
tiling <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{Q}\)</span> implies that the
contractibility of any closed walk depends only on its (cyclic) turn
sequence. Moreover, we can easily compute the turn sequence of any walk
in time proportional to its length.</p>
<p>A <em>right bracket</em> is any subpath whose turn sequence consists
of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, followed by zero or more
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>s, followed by <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. A <em>left bracket</em> is any subpath
whose turn sequence has the form <span class="math inline">\(-1, -2,
\dots, -2, -1\)</span>, for any number of <span
class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>s. (In the interest of readability,
from now on I will indicate negation with a bar instead of a minus sign;
for example, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{2} = -2\)</span>.)</p>

<strong><em>[Combinatorial Gauss-Bonnet again.]</em></strong>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The previous lemma implies that we can reduce any nontrivial
contractible closed walk in <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>
either using a spur move or by “sliding” a bracket. Both of these moves
can be performed entirely by modifying the turn sequence. For example,
removing a spur preceded by turn <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and followed by turn <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> leaves a
single turn with value <span class="math inline">\(x+y\)</span>. (All
turn arithmetic is implicitly performed modulo <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span>.) <span class="math display">\[

<h2 data-number="1.7" id="reduction-algorithm"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Reduction algorithm</h2>
<p>To make detecting and sliding brackets easier, we actually store and
manipulate a <em>run-length encoding</em> of the turn sequence. Instead
of recording repeated turns explicitly, we store a sequence of pairs
<span class="math inline">\(((\tau_0, r_0), (\tau_1, r_1),
\dots)\)</span> to represent <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>
repetitions of turn <span class="math inline">\(\tau_0\)</span>,
followed by <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> repetitions of
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span>, and so on. Thus, any
bracket turn sequence overlaps at most five runs. (In fact, it suffices
to encode only runs of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>s and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar2\)</span>s.)</p>
<p>We now proceed as in Dehn’s classical algorithm. We slide a window of
width <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> over the run-length-encoded
turn sequence; whenever the window contains a spur or a bracket, we
modify the runs within the window to perform a spur move or bracket
move, and then move the window back five steps. At each window position,
we need <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time to detect spurs
and brackets, and <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time to
perform each spur of bracket move. The algorithm iterates until we have
made a complete scan with no reductions, in which case we are done, or
at most five runs remain in the run sequence, in which case we can
complete the algorithm in O(1) additional time. Standard amortisation
arguments imply that the reduction algorithm runs in <span
class="math inline">\(O(\ell)\)</span> time.</p>
<p>Thus, the overall running time of Dehn’s algorithm, starting with an
arbitrary surface map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with
complexity <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, is <span
class="math inline">\(O(n + \ell)\)</span>, with no hidden dependence on
the surface genus.</p>
