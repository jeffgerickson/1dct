class="math inline">\(^\alpha\)</span></h1>
<p>There’s not a lot in this section about <em>algorithms</em>, but
there is a lot of important <em>structure</em>. Everything described in
this note is based on <em>tree-cotree</em> decompositions.</p>
<p>Recall from the previous lecture that a <em>tree-cotree
decomposition</em> of a surface map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is a partition of the edges <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> into three disjoint subsets <span
class="math inline">\(T\sqcup L\sqcup C\)</span>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a spanning tree of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> is a spanning tree of the
dual map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L = E\setminus (C\cup T)\)</span> is the
set of <em>leftover</em> edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every surface map has a tree-cotree decomposition <span
class="math inline">\((T,L,C)\)</span>. In fact, we can choose either
the spanning tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> or the
complementary dual spanning tree <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>
arbitrarily, just as we did for tree-cotree decompositions of planar
maps.</p>
<p>More generally, suppose we modify a map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> by repeatedly either (1)
contracting an arbitrary non-loop edge or (2) deleting an arbitrary
non-isthmus edge, until eery edge is both a loop and an isthmus. Let
<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the set of contracted edges,
let <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be the set of deleted edges,
and let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the final set of
isthmus-loops (loop-isthmuses?). Then <span
class="math inline">\((T,L,C)\)</span> is a tree-cotree decomposition of
the original map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>Equivalently, suppose we color the edges of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> red, green, or blue in arbitrary
order so that (1) every cycle contains at least one blue edge, (2) every
edge cut contains at least one red edge, and (3) an edge is green if and
only if it cannot be colored either red or blue. Then the red, green,
and blue edges respectively define the spanning tree, leftover edges,
and spanning cotree of a tree-cotree decomposition.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="cut-graphs"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Cut Graphs</h2>
<p>A <em>cut graph</em> of a map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> on surface <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is any subgraph <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} \setminus X\)</span> an open
topological disk. (Let me emphasize that here <span
class="math inline">\(\setminus\)</span> means to remove the points from
the space, not merely deleting the edges from the map.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can define cut graphs in terms of a generalization
of the <em>slicing</em> operation we already saw in the context of
separators and minimum cuts. Slicing a map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> along a subgraph <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> produces a new map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\mathbin{\backslash\!\!\backslash}
X\)</span> which contains <span class="math inline">\(\deg_X(v)\)</span>
copies of every vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, two copies of every edge of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and at least one new face in addition
to the faces of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. By
convention, we think of the faces of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\mathbin{\backslash\!\!\backslash}
X\)</span> that are not faces of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> as <em>holes</em> that are missing
from the surface; thus, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\mathbin{\backslash\!\!\backslash}
X\)</span> is always a map of a surface <em>with boundary</em>. At least
intuitively, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\mathbin{\backslash\!\!\backslash}
X\)</span> is the map obtained by gluing together the faces of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> along every edge that is
<em>not</em> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Then a cut graph
of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is any subgraph <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\mathbin{\backslash\!\!\backslash}
X\)</span> is a closed disk.</p>
<p><strong><em>[[[Figure]]]</em></strong></p>
<p>For any tree-cotree decomposition <span
class="math inline">\((T,L,C)\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, the subgraph <span
class="math inline">\(T\cup L\)</span> is a cut graph of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. Typically the cut graph <span
class="math inline">\(X = T\cup L\)</span> will contain several vertices
with degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; removing any such
vertex from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> yields a smaller cut
graph. A <em>reduced</em> cut graph is a cut graph with no degree-1
vertices at all; equivalently, a reduced cut graph is a <em>minimal</em>
subgraph <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma \mathbin{\backslash\!\!\backslash}
X\)</span> is a disk. We can <em>reduce</em> any cut graph by repeatedly
removing degree-1 vertices until none are left.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In any surface map with Euler genus <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{g} = 2-\chi &gt; 1\)</span>, every reduced
cut graph can be further decomposed into at most <span
class="math inline">\(2\bar{g}-2\)</span> <em>cut paths</em> between at
most <span class="math inline">\(3\bar{g}-3\)</span> vertices with
degree at least <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, called
<em>branch points</em>. In particular, if every branch point has degree
exactly <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, there are exactly <span
class="math inline">\(3\bar{g}-3\)</span> branch points and <span
class="math inline">\(2\bar{g}-2\)</span> cut paths. (The only two
exceptional surfaces are the projective plane (non-orientable genus
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), where every reduced cut graph
is a single one-sided cycle, and the sphere (orientable genus <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>), where by convention every reduced cut
graph is a single vertex.)</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" id="systems-of-loops-and-homotopy"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Systems of Loops and
Homotopy</h2>
<p>Fix an arbitrary vertex <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,
called the <em>basepoint</em>. For each vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{path}(v)\)</span> denote the unique
directed path in the spanning tree <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. For every dart <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{loop}(d)\)</span> denote the following
directed closed walk: <span class="math display">\[
    \textsf{loop}(d)
    :=
    \textsf{path}(\textsf{tail}(d))
        \cdot d
        \cdot \textsf{rev}(\textsf{path}(\textsf{head}(d))).
\]</span> Notice that <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{loop}(\textsf{rev}(d)) =
\textsf{rev}(\textsf{loop}(d))\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L} = \{
\textsf{loop}(e^+) \mid e\in L \}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(e^+\)</span> denotes an arbitrary
<em>reference</em> dart for edge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.
The set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> is called a
<em>system of loops</em> for <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recall that two closed curves in some space <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are <em>(freely) homotopic</em> if one
curve can be continuously deformed into the other on <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Similarly, two paths in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with the same endpoints are
<em>homotopic</em> if one path can be continuously deformed into the
other while keeping the endpoints fixed. A system of loops gives us the
necessary structure to decide whether two curves are homotopic,
similarly to the “fences” in our planar homotopy-testing algorithm.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="whats-a-curve"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> What’s a “curve”?</h2>
<p>But before we can start talking concretely about algorithms, we have
to nail down the phrase “given two curves” and “given a surface”. Our
planar homotopy algorithm assumes that input curves are given as
<em>polygons</em>, specified as a sequence of vertex coordinates; while
it is possible to <em>impose</em> coordinates on surfaces that would
permit a natural generalization of “polygons”, imposing geometry is
almost always both wasteful and unnecessary.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It is usually simpler and more efficient to treat curves on surfaces
purely combinatorially, representing surfaces as <em>maps</em> (using
rotation systems or reflection systems), and representing curves using
one of two natural combinatorial models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Traversal</em>: We consider only curves that are walks in the
graph of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>; curves cannot
intersect faces, and if a curve intersects an edge, it must traverse
that edge monotonically from one end to the other. We can represent any
such curve as an alternating sequence of vertices and darts (directed
edges). If the edges of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> are
weighted, the <em>length</em> of a curve <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the sum of the weights of the
edges that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> traverses,
counted with appropriate multiplicity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Crossing</em>: We consider only curves that intersect the
edges of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> transversely, away
from the vertices, and whose intersection with each face of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is simple (injective). We can
represent any such curve as an alternating sequence of faces and knives
(oriented edges). If the edges of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> are weighted, the <em>length</em>
of a curve <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the sum of the
weights of the edges that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
crosses, counted with appropriate multiplicity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These two models are clearly dual to each other; a crossing curve in
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is equivalent to—or more
formally, <strong>IS</strong>—a traversing curve in the dual map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>, and vice versa. Which curve
model we choose is strictly a matter of convenience. For the rest of
this lecture, I’ll use the traversal model.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="spur-and-face-moves"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Spur and Face Moves</h2>
<p>Even though we do not allow the <em>input</em> curves to intersect
the interiors of faces, we cannot impose the same restriction on
<em>homotopies</em>. Recall that we can think of any homotopy as a
continuously deforming curve. Even though the deforming curve starts and
ends on the vertices and edges of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, it may pass through faces in some
or all intermediate stages.</p>
<p>However, just as with generic curves in the plane, it turns out that
any homotopy between traversal curves in surface maps can be decomposed
into a finite sequence of combinatorial <em>moves</em>, of two
types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <em>spur</em> move either inserts or deletes a subpath
consisting of a dart followed by its reversal; we call such a subpath a
<em>spur</em> (or sometimes a <em>spike</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>face</em> move replaces a subpath of the boundary of some
face <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with the complementary
subpath on the boundary of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Traversal homotopy moves: A spur move

</figure>
<p>Thus, asking whether a closed walk <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> in some map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is contractible is a purely
combinatorial problem: Is there a sequence of spur and face moves that
transforms <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> into a trivial
walk?</p>
<p>There is a dual pair of homotopy moves for crossing curves. The dual
of a spur move, called a <em>bigon</em> move, deforms the curve to
either insert or remove two consecutive crossings of the same edge. The
dual of a face move, called a <em>vertex</em> move, deforms the curve
across one vertex.</p>

In light of the previous lemma, it suffices to consider only walks in
the cut graph <span class="math inline">\(T\cup L\)</span>. Consider the
closed walk <span class="math inline">\(w =
v_0{\to}v_1{\to}v_2{\to}\cdots{\to}v_L\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(v_0 = v_L = x\)</span>. We easily observe that
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is homotopic to the concatenation
of paths <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\textsf{path}(v_0)

\]</span> because the initial path <span

empty, and every intermediate path through <span

reversal.

<p>Thus, it suffices to argue that every fundamental loop <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{loop}(d)\)</span> is homotopic to a loop
in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}^*\)</span>. Again, in light
of the previous lemma, there are only two cases to consider:</p>

</ul>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(|d| \in T\)</span>. Then <span

<p>This lemma does not <em>uniquely</em> characterize homotopy classes
