<p>Now let’s generalize the homotopy problem from the last lecture to
the case of more than one obstacle. Let <span class="math inline">\(O =
\{a, b, c, \dots\}\)</span> be an arbitrary finite set of points in the
plane. The definitions of homotopy and contractible easily generalize to
polygons (and other closed curves) in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus O\)</span>. How quickly can
we tell whether two polygons in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus O\)</span> are
homotopic?</p>
<figure>
<img src="Fig/fast-and-loose-cheat.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="The Endless Chain again" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Endless Chain again</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game Fast and Loose shows some of the subtlety of this problem.
Let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be arbitrarily points in each of the
two loops of the curve <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> that the
con artist actually uses. It’s not hard to see that <span
class="math inline">\(wind(c, a) = wind(C, b) = 0\)</span>; any ray
upward from either <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> has one positive crossing and one
negative crossing. Thus, the curve is contractible in the plane with
only <em>one</em> of these punctures; in other words, the chain is loose
if we only use one finger. But the curve <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is <em>not</em> contractible in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{a, b\}\)</span>; we can
hold the chain fast by placing a finger in each loop. Winding numbers
are <em>not</em> a homotopy invariant when there is more than one
obstacle.</p>
<p>Just as in the one-obstacle setting, we can (approximately) decompose
any homotopy between two polygons in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus O\)</span> into safe vertex
moves, where now a vertex move is <em>safe</em> if the moving vertex and
its incident edges avoids <em>all</em> points in <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. Essentially the same argument from the
previous lecture implies the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Theorem:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Two polygons in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus
O\)</span> are homotopic if and only if they are connected by a sequence
of safe vertex moves.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="crossing-sequences"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Crossing Sequences</h2>
<p>However, we can still define a homotopy invariant by shooting rays
out of <em>every</em> obstacle, and recording how the polygon intersects
these rays. Specifically, we record not only the <em>number</em> of
times the polygon crosses each ray, but the actual order and directions
of these crossings.</p>
<p>As usual, we will assume without loss of generality that the
obstacles have distinct <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinates. Shoot a vertical ray
upward from each obstacle point; I’ll call these vertical rays
<em>fences</em>. The <em>crossing sequence</em> of a polygon <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus O\)</span> is the sequence
of intersections between the fences and the polygon, in order along the
polygon, along with the sign of each crossing (positive if the polygon
crosses the fence to the left, negative if the polygon crosses the fence
to the right).</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows a polygon in the plane with two obstacle points <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. If we orient the polygon as indicated
by the arrows, starting at the lower left corner, the crossing sequence
is <strong><code>BAabBAabB</code></strong>, where each upper-case letter
denotes a positive crossing through the corresponding fence, and each
lower-case letter denotes a negative crossing through the corresponding
fence.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Lemma:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Two polygons in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus
O\)</span> with the same crossing sequence are homotopic.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
I’ll describe a homotopy that transforms any polygon <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> into a <em>canonical</em> polygon with
the same crossing sequence. (With more care, the homotopy can be
described explicitly as a sequence of safe vertex moves.)
</dd>
<dd>
<p>First, we define two new <em>sentinel</em> points <span
class="math inline">\(a^\flat\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a^\sharp\)</span> just above and on either side of
each obstacle <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. These points are
close enough to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> that no vertex of
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, no other obstacle, and no other
sentinel point lies on or between the vertical lines through <span
class="math inline">\(a^\flat\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a^\sharp\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Next, we <em>divert</em> edges through the sentinel points, by adding
two additional vertices near each intersection between <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and any fence, and then moving those
new vertices to the sentinel points near the corresponding obstacle.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the original edge crosses <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s fence from right to left (a positive
crossing), the diverted edge passes through sentinel points <span
class="math inline">\(a^\sharp\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a^\flat\)</span> in that order.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the original edge crosses <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s fence from left to right (a negative
crossing), the diverted edge passes through sentinel points <span
class="math inline">\(a^\flat\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a^\sharp\)</span> in that order.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
See Figure 3. The resulting polygon <span
class="math inline">\(P&#39;\)</span> has the same crossing sequence as
the original polygon <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Finally, we divert the rest of the polygon to a single point far
below any obstacle. First we add a new vertex at the midpoint of each
edge of <span class="math inline">\(P&#39;\)</span> between two sentinel
points of different obstacles. Then we choose a point <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> sufficiently far below the polygon and
the sentinel points that for any polygon vertex <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the segment <span
class="math inline">\(zp\)</span> does not cross any of the fences.
Finally, we move every vertex of <span
class="math inline">\(P&#39;\)</span> that is <em>not</em> a sentinel
point directly to this new bottom point <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Again, this deformation does not
change the polygon’s crossing sequence.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The resulting canonical polygon <span
class="math inline">\(P&#39;&#39;\)</span> is a concatenation of loops
of the form <span class="math inline">\(z a^\flat a^\sharp z\)</span>
(for each negative crossing) or <span class="math inline">\(z a^\sharp
a^\flat z\)</span> (for each positive crossing).</p>
</dd>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Corollary:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Any polygon in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus
O\)</span> with an empty crossing sequence is contractible.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unfortunately, the converses of these two results are false; a
homotopy that moves one polygon vertex across one fence either inserts
or deletes a pair of crossings in the polygon’s crossing sequence. Thus,
crossing sequences are not homotopy invariants. Fortunately, this is the
<em>only</em> way that a homotopy can change the crossing sequence.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="reductions"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Reductions</h2>
<p>We regard signed crossing sequences as strings of abstract symbols,
where each symbol <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has a formal
“inverse” <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span>. In our earlier
example, each upper case letter is the inverse of the corresponding
lower-case letter, and vice versa. Let <span
class="math inline">\(x\cdot y\)</span> denote the concatenation of
strings <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> denote the empty string.</p>
<p>An <em>elementary reduction</em> is a transformation of the form
<span class="math inline">\(x\cdot a\bar{a}\cdot y \mapsto x\cdot
y\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are (possibly empty) strings and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a single symbol. An <em>elementary
expansion</em> is the reverse transformation <span
class="math inline">\(x\cdot y \mapsto x\cdot a\bar{a}\cdot y\)</span>.
Two strings are <em>equivalent</em> if once can be transformed into the
other by a sequence of elementary reductions and expansions. (Check for
yourself that equivalence is in fat an equivalence relation!) We call a
string <em>trivial</em> if it is equivalent to the empty string <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>. Finally, a string is
<em>reduced</em> if no elementary reductions are possible; for example,
the empty string <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is
trivially reduced, as is any string of length <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Crossing sequences of polygons are actually <em>cyclic</em> strings.
Formally, a cyclic string is an equivalence class of linear strings:
<span class="math display">\[
    (w) := \{ y\cdot x \mid x\cdot y = w \}
\]</span> For example, (<code>ABbA</code>) = {<code>ABbA</code>,
<code>BbAA</code>, <code>bAAB</code>, <code>AABb</code>} and <span
class="math inline">\((\varepsilon) = \{\varepsilon\}\)</span>. I’ll
write <span class="math inline">\(w \sim z\)</span> to denote that <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is a cyclic shift of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, or equivalently <span
class="math inline">\(w\in(z)\)</span>, or equivalently <span
class="math inline">\(z\in (w)\)</span>. To emphasize that elementary
reductions can “wrap around” cyclic strings, we say that a cyclic string
is <em>cyclically reduced</em> if no elementary reductions are possible.
A (cyclic) string is <em>trivial</em> if it is equivalent to the empty
(cyclic) string.</p>
<p>For example, the cyclic string
(<code>EcaCbaABcEeEeAdbcCBaEdDeADCe</code>) is trivial; two different
sequences of elementary reductions are shown below (using interpuncts to
represent missing symbols). In the first sequence, each elementary
reduction removes the <em>leftmost</em> matching pair; the second
sequence is more haphazard. In fact, as the following lemma implies,
<em>any</em> sequence of elementary reductions eventually reduces this
string to nothing.</p>

Every cyclic string is equivalent to exactly one cyclically reduced
cyclic string.

<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Let <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be a cyclic string that
allows two elementary reductions <span class="math inline">\(w\mapsto
x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\mapsto y\)</span>, meaning
two different pairs of symbols are deleted. We claim that either <span
class="math inline">\(x=y\)</span> or there is another string <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\mapsto z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\mapsto z\)</span> are elementary reductions.
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the pairs of symbols deleted by <span
class="math inline">\(w\mapsto x\)</span> and <span

c\bar{c} \cdot w_2)\)</span> for some (possibly empty) linear strings
<span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> and (possibly equal, possibly
inverse) symbols <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Without loss of generality we have
<span class="math inline">\(x = (w_1 \cdot c\bar{c} \cdot w_2)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y = (w_2 \cdot a\bar{a} \cdot
w_1)\)</span>. In this case, we can take <span class="math inline">\(z =
(w_1 w_2)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the pairs of symbols deleted by <span

class="math inline">\(w\mapsto y\)</span> overlap, then we can write
<span class="math inline">\(w = (a \bar{a} a \cdot w&#39;)\)</span> for
some (possibly empty) linear string <span
class="math inline">\(w&#39;\)</span> and some symbol <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. In this case we have <span
class="math inline">\(x = y = (a \cdot w&#39;)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>It follows that applying <em>only</em> elementary reductions leads to
a unique reduced string; however, equivalence also allows elementary
<em>expansions</em>. Consider two equivalent but distinct cyclic strings
<span class="math inline">\(x\ne y\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(x = w_1 \leftrightarrow w_2 \leftrightarrow \cdots
\leftrightarrow w_n = y\)</span> be a sequence of strings, each
connected to its success by an elementary reduction in one direction
<span class="math inline">\(w_i \mapsto w_{i+1}\)</span> or the other
<span class="math inline">\(w_{i+1} \mapsto w_i\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Suppose for some index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we
have reductions <span class="math inline">\(w_i \mapsto w_{i-1}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(w_i \mapsto w_{i+1}\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(w_{i-1} = w_{i+1}\)</span>, then we can remove
<span class="math inline">\(w_{i-1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> to obtain a shorter transformation
sequence. Otherwise, there is another string <span
class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_{i-1}\mapsto z_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w_{i+1} \mapsto z_i\)</span>. Thus, by induction,
we can modify our transformation sequence so that every reduction
appears before every expansion.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> be the shortest string in
this normalized sequence. Both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be reduced to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> using only elementary reductions.
Because <span class="math inline">\(x\ne y\)</span>, either <span
class="math inline">\(x \ne z\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y\ne z\)</span>; we conclude that at most one of
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span

finite number of elementary reductions and their inverses, at most one
per obstacle.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Conversely, any elementary reduction of the signed crossing sequence
can be modeled by a sequence of safe vertex moves, performed either
directly on the original polygon or (more easily) on the canonical
polygon with the same crossing sequence.</p>

<dd>
For any set <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> points in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, and any two <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gons <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus O\)</span>, we can determine
whether <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are homotopic in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus O\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(k\log k + kn)\)</span> time.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof (sketch):</strong></dt>
<dd>
As usual we assume without loss of generality that the obstacles and
polygon vertices all have distinct <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinates. First we sort the
obstacles from left to right in <span class="math inline">\(O(k\log
k)\)</span> time. Then we compute the crossing sequence of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, in constant time per crossing, plus
constant time per vertex. Each crossing sequence has length <span
class="math inline">\(O(nk)\)</span>. Then we cyclically reduce the two
crossing sequences in <span class="math inline">\(O(nk)\)</span> time.
Finally, we check whether the two reduced crossing sequences are equal
(as <em>cyclic</em> strings) in linear time using Knuth-Morris-Pratt (or
any other fast string-matching algorithm).

<p>Let me emphasize here that the algorithm does not construct an
explicit homotopy between the two polygons.</p>
