<h2 data-number="1.1" id="monge-heaps"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Monge Heaps</h2>
<p>Recall that a two-dimensional array <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is <em>Monge</em> if the inequality
<span class="math inline">\(M[i,j] + M[i’,j’] \le M[i’,j] +
M[i,j’]\)</span> holds for all indices <span
class="math inline">\(i&lt;i’\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j&lt;j’\)</span>. Any array where the columns are
constant is Monge, and the sum of any two Monge arrays is Monge.</p>
<p>Suppose we are given a <span class="math inline">\(k\times k\)</span>
Monge array <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and we are
<em>promised</em> that there is a <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-dimensional vector <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Then no matter what values <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> contains, the array <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> defined by <span
class="math inline">\(M[i,j] = D[i,j] + c[j]\)</span> is Monge.</p>
<p>A <em>Monge heap</em> is a data structure that allows us to extract
information from the array <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as the
coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are revealed.
Specifically, a Monge heap supports the following three operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}(j, x)\)</span>: Declare
that <span class="math inline">\(c[j] = x\)</span>, thereby revealing
the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th column of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\textsf{FindMin}()\)</span>: Return the
smallest visible element in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We
are guaranteed that this element is the smallest element in its row of
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, not just the smallest
<em>visible</em> element of that row.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}(i)\)</span>: Hide the row
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which must contain the smallest
visible element of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (which is also
the smallest element of its row of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the lifetime of the data structure, we will <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}\)</span> at most <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> columns and <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}\)</span> at most <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rows.</p>
<p>An element of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is
<em>visible</em> if its column has been <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}\)</span>ed but its row has not
been <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hid}\)</span>d<span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{e}\)</span>n. We call an element of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> <em>active</em> if it is the smallest
visible element in a visible row. Each visible column of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> contains zero or more contiguous
intervals of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which we call
<em>active intervals</em>. Each active interval is specified by a triple
of indices <span class="math inline">\((j, i_{\min},
i_{\max})\)</span>.</p>

alt="Operations on a Monge heap, initially with four visible columns and no hidden rows." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Operations on a Monge heap, initially
with four visible columns and no hidden rows.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A Monge heap consists of three component data structures (described
in more detail below):</p>
<ul>
<li>A priority queue storing all live intervals within the visible
columns of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></li>
<li>A balanced binary search tree storing the live intervals in
lexicographic order</li>
<li>A range-minimum query structure for each column of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> (sic)</li>
</ul>
<p>These data structures support each <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span> amortized time, <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{FindMin}\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time, and <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span> time. Over the lifetime of the
data structure, we call each of these operations at most <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> times, thereby finding the minimum
elements in some subset of the rows of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(k\log
k)\)</span> time. (This is slower than the <span
class="math inline">\(O(k)\)</span> running time of SMAWK, but that
algorithm requires the entire array <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be visible from the beginning.)</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" id="the-main-priority-queue"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> The main priority queue</h3>
<p>At all times, the submatrix (or minor) of visible elements in <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is Monge. This implies that the minimum
<em>visible</em> elements in the <em>visible</em> rows of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are <em>monotone</em>: The index of the
row minimum is a non-decreasing function of the row index. More
explicitly: For any indices <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;i’\)</span>
of visible rows, if <span class="math inline">\(M[i,j]\)</span> is the
minimum (visible) element of row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>,
and <span class="math inline">\(M[i’,j’]\)</span> is the minimum
(visible) element of row <span class="math inline">\(i’\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(j\le j’\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, each visible column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> contains the smallest elements of
a interval of visible rows, which may be broken into smaller intervals
by hidden rows. Each <em>live interval</em> can be described by a triple
of indices <span class="math inline">\((j, i_{\min}, i_{\max})\)</span>,
indicating that <span class="math inline">\(M[i,j]\)</span> is the
minimum element in every row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(i_{\min}\le i\le i_{\max}\)</span>, and
moreover none of those rows has been hidden. The live intervals
partition the visible rows of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, so
there are at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of them at any
time.</p>
<p>We maintain the live intervals <span class="math inline">\((j,
i_{\min}, i_{\max})\)</span> in a priority queue, implemented as a
standard binary min-heap, where the priority of any interval is its
smallest element. In particular, the smallest visible element in <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the priority of the live interval at
the root of the heap, so we can support <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{FindMin}\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.2" id="range-minimum-queries"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Range-minimum queries</h3>
<p>The smallest element in any live interval <span
class="math inline">\((j, i_{\min}, i_{\max})\)</span> depends only on
the known Monge matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. To
compute these minimum elements quickly, we preprocess each column <span
class="math inline">\(D[\cdot, j]\)</span> into a data structure that
supports <em>range-minimum queries</em> of the following form:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\textsf{RMQ}(j, i_{\min},
i_{\max})\)</span>: Return the index <span
class="math inline">\(i_{\min}\le i\le i_{\max}\)</span> that minimizes
<span class="math inline">\(D[i,j]\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The range-minimum data structure consists of a static balanced binary
search tree with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> leaves. The
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th leaf stores <span
class="math inline">\(D[i,j]\)</span>, and every internal node stores
the minimum value of its two children, along with the index of the leaf
storing that value. This data structure is constructed once at the start
of the algorithm, in <span class="math inline">\(O(k)\)</span> time, and
it answers any range-minimum query in <span class="math inline">\(O(\log
k)\)</span> time.</p>
<p>Whenever we <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Insert}\)</span> a
new live interval <span class="math inline">\((j, i_{\min},
i_{\max})\)</span> into the priority queue, we perform a range-minimum
query to determine the priority of that interval. Thus, the overall
<span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Insert}\)</span>ion time is <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span>. The other priority queue
operations <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{ExtractMin}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Delete}\)</span> also take <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span> time.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.3" id="revealing-a-column"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Revealing a column</h3>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}(j, x)\)</span> is
implemented in <span class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span> amortized
time as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the live intervals <span class="math inline">\(I^- = (j^-,
i_{\min}^-, i_{\min}^-)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I^+ =
(j^+, i_{\min}^+, i_{\min}^+)\)</span> immediately before and after
<span class="math inline">\((j, \cdot, \cdot)\)</span> in lexicographic
order, in <span class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span> time, by
querying the balanced binary search tree.</p></li>
<li><p>While <span class="math inline">\(M[i_{\min}^-, j] &lt;
M[i_{\min}^-, j^-]\)</span>, replace <span
class="math inline">\(I^-\)</span> with its predecessor in lexicographic
order. Then binary search for the smallest index <span
class="math inline">\(i_{\min}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(M[i_{\min}, j] &lt; M[i_{\min},
j^-]\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>While <span class="math inline">\(M[i_{\min}^+, j] &lt;
M[i_{\min}^+, j^+]\)</span>, replace <span
class="math inline">\(I^+\)</span> with its successor in lexicographic
order. Then binary search for the smallest index <span
class="math inline">\(i_{\max}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(M[i_{\max}, j] &lt; M[i_{\min},
j^+]\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete any live intervals <span class="math inline">\((j^\pm,
\cdot, \cdot)\)</span> that overlap <span class="math inline">\((j,
i_{\min}, i_{\max})\)</span> from the priority queue.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the new live intervals <span class="math inline">\((j,
i_{\min}, i_{\max})\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((j^-, \cdot,
i_{\min}-1)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((j^+, i_{\max}+1,
\cdot)\)</span> into the priority queue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain the claimed <span class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span>
amortized time bound, we charge the time to delete any interval from the
priority queue to its earlier insertion. The requirement that we only
<span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}\)</span> rows when their
minimum elements are visible implies that there is exactly one live
interval in the <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}\)</span>ed
column.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.4" id="hiding-a-row"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Hiding a row</h3>
<p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}(i)\)</span> is
implemented in <span class="math inline">\(O(\log k)\)</span> time as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extract the live interval <span class="math inline">\((j,
i_{\min}, i_{\max})\)</span> from the root of the priority queue.
Because row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> contains the smallest
visible element in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, that smallest
element is <span class="math inline">\(M[i,j]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(i_{\min}\le i\le i_{\max}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the smallest element <span
class="math inline">\(M[i,j]\)</span> in that interval using a
range-minimum query.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the live intervals <span class="math inline">\((j,
i_{\min}, i-1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((j, i+1,
i_{\max})\)</span> into the priority queue.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="monge-structure-of-nice-r-divisions"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Monge structure of nice <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-divisions</h2>
<p>Suppose we are given a planar map <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> (called <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> in the previous lecture) with
non-negatively weighted edges. Recall that a nice <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division partitions <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> into <span
class="math inline">\(O(n/r)\)</span> <em>pieces</em>, each with <span
class="math inline">\(O(r)\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r})\)</span> boundary vertices, and each
with the topology of a disk with <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> holes.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> denote the array of
boundary-to-boundary distances for a single piece <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> of this <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division. I claim that we can represent
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> using a small number of Monge
arrays. We need to consider two types of boundary-to-boundary distances,
depending on whether the two vertices lie on the same hole of <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> or on different holes.</p>
<p>First, consider two holes in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>,
with boundaries <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Think of <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> as a map on the annulus, with boundary
cycles <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> be the shortest path from any vertex
<span class="math inline">\(a_1 \in \alpha\)</span> to any vertex <span
class="math inline">\(b_1\in \beta\)</span>. For any vertices <span
class="math inline">\(a_i\in \alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b_j\in \beta\)</span>, the shortest path in <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> either does not cross <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> at all, crosses <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> positively once, or crosses <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> negatively once. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta = R\setminus\!\!\setminus \pi\)</span>, and
let <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^2\)</span> be the map obtained by
gluing two copies of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>
together along <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, as shown in the
figure below. Then we have <span class="math display">\[
    \textsf{dist}_R(a_i, b_j) =
    \min\left\{
        \begin{gathered}
            \textsf{dist}_\Delta(a_i, b_j) \\[0.25ex]
            \textsf{dist}_{\Delta^2}(a_i^+, b_j^-) \\
            \textsf{dist}_{\Delta^2}(a_i^-, b_j^+)
        \end{gathered}
    \right\}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v^+\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v^-\)</span> denote the two copies of vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta^2\)</span>. Thus, the array <span
class="math inline">\(D(\alpha,\beta)\)</span> of pairwise distances
between vertices of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and
vertices of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the
element-wise minimum of three Monge arrays.</p>

alt="Three types of boundary-to-boundary shortest paths in an annulus." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Three types of boundary-to-boundary
shortest paths in an annulus.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next consider a single hole in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
with boundary <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>; by
construction <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> has at most
<span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r})\)</span> vertices. As we saw two
lectures ago, the array <span class="math inline">\(D(\alpha)\)</span>
of pairwise distances in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> between
vertices in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is
<em>almost</em> Monge. Instead of splitting this array into
<em>partial</em> Monge arrays, we recursively partition it into <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r})\)</span> square Monge subarrays.
Specifically, the upper right and lower left quadrants of <span
class="math inline">\(D(\alpha)\)</span> are both Monge, and we
recursively subdivide the lower left and upper right quadrants. Every
row or column of <span class="math inline">\(D(\alpha)\)</span>
intersects at most <span class="math inline">\(O(\log r)\)</span> of
these square subarrays. The total perimeter of these Monge arrays is
<span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r} \log r)\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Fig/quadtree-Monge.png" style="width:25.0%"
alt="Recursive partition of a circular Monge array into square Monge subarrays." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Recursive partition of a circular Monge
array into square Monge subarrays.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Putting these two cases together, we can represent the
boundary-to-boundary distances within each piece <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> using <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r})\)</span> Monge arrays, with total area
<span class="math inline">\(O(r)\)</span> and total perimeter <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r}\log r)\)</span>. Altogether there are
<span class="math inline">\(O(n/\sqrt{r})\)</span> Monge arrays
associated with the entire <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division, with total area <span
class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> and total perimeter <span
class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r})\log r)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, suppose we associate a Monge heap with every Monge array in
every piece of our <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division. Then
the total number of <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}\)</span> operations we can
perform is <span class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r})\log r)\)</span>,
and each of those operations takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log
r)\)</span> amortized time. Thus, the total time spent constructing and
maintaining all Monge heaps, over their entire lifetimes, over the
entire <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division, is <span
class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r}) \log^2 r)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="fr-dijkstra"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> FR-Dijkstra</h2>
<p>Fakcharoenphol and Rao implement their improvement to Dijkstra’s
algorithm as follows. We begin by computing a nice <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division for <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and the dense-distance graph for
that <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log r)\)</span> time, for some value of <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to be determined later.</p>
<p>The query phase of FR-Dijkstra solves the single-source shortest path
problem in the dense distance graph: Given a boundary vertex <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in our <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division, compute the shortest-path
distance to every other boundary vertex in the <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division. The algorithm mirrors the
Dijkstra’s algorithm, but using a nested collection of heaps instead of
a standard priority queue:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{r})\)</span> Monge heaps for
each piece of the <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division, once
for each Monge array in the decomposition described above.</p></li>
<li><p>A standard priority queue, called a <em>piece heap</em>, for each
piece of the <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division, containing
the minimum elements of every Monge heap associated with that piece. We
automatically update the piece heap whenever the minimum element of a
Monge heap changes.</p></li>
<li><p>A standard priority queue, called the <em>global heap</em>,
containing the minimum elements of the piece heaps. We automatically
update the global heap whenever the minimum element of a piece heap
changes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To begin the algorithm, we initialize all the component heaps to
empty, call <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}(s, 0)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}(s)\)</span> inside every
Monge heap containing the source vertex <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. In alter iterations, whenever we
extract the next closest vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>
from the global priority queue, we call <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{Reveal}(v, \textsf{dist}(v))\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\textsf{Hide}(v)\)</span> in every Monge
heap containing vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. By
induction, the vertex at the top of the global heap is always the
closest boundary vertex beyond the current Dijkstra wavefront.</p>
<p>The running time of the algorithm is dominated by the time spent
maintain the three different levels of heaps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As we argued above, the total time spent managing all Monge heaps
is <span class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r}) \log^2
r)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For each piece <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we perform
<span class="math inline">\(O(\log r)\)</span> operations in <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>’s piece heap for each boundary vertex
of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Thus, the number of
piece-heap operations across the entire <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division is <span
class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r}) \log r)\)</span>; each piece-heap
operation takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log r)\)</span>
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, each iteration of Dijkstra’s algorithm removes one
vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> from the global heap and
performs at most one deletion and one inserti on for each piece
containing <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. Said differently, for
each piece <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we perform <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> global-heap operations for boundary
vertex of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. So the total number of
global-heap operations is <span
class="math inline">\(O(n/\sqrt{r})\)</span>; each global-heap operation
takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the overall running time of the query phase of FR-Dijkstra is
<span class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r})(\log^2r + \log n))\)</span>.
(The final <span class="math inline">\(\log n\)</span> term can be
eliminated with more effort.)</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" id="back-to-minimum-cut"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Back to minimum cut</h2>
<p>In the previous lecture, we reduced computing minimum <span
class="math inline">\((s,t)\)</span>-cuts to the following problem.
Given a planar map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with
non-negatively weighted weighted edges, and vertices <span
class="math inline">\(s_0, s_1, \dots, s_k, t_k, \dots, t_1,
t_0\)</span> in cyclic order on the outer face, compute the shortest
path distance <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{dist}(s_i,
t_i)\)</span> for every index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
Reif’s algorithm solves this problem in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log k)\)</span> time by computing the
<em>median</em> shortest path <span class="math inline">\(\pi_m\)</span>
from <span class="math inline">\(s_m\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t_m\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(m=\lfloor k/2 \rfloor\)</span>, and then recursing
on both sides of the sliced map <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma
\backslash\!\!\backslash \pi_m\)</span>.</p>
<p>The more efficient algorithm of Italiano et al. follows Reif’s
divide-and-conquer strategy, in three phases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <em>initialization</em> phase, we construct a nice <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, construct its dense distance
graph by running MSSP in each piece, and initialize the range-minimum
trees needed to support FR-Dijkstra. This phase runs in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log r)\)</span> time.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \lfloor \log_2 k
\rfloor\)</span>. In the <em>coarse</em> divide-and-conquer phase, we
compute shortest paths from <span
class="math inline">\(s_{i\lambda}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t_{i\lambda}\)</span> for all indices <span
class="math inline">\(0\le i\le \lfloor i/\lambda \rfloor\)</span>,
using Reif’s divide-and-conquer strategy, using FR-Dijkstra to compute
each shortest path.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in the <em>fine</em> divide-and-conquer phase, we run
Reif’s algorithm within each of the <span
class="math inline">\(O(k/\lambda)\)</span> slabs left by the previous
phase, using the linear-time shortest path algorithm to compute each
shortest path. Since each slab has only <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda = O(\log k)\)</span> terminal pairs on its
boundary, the total time for this phase is <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log\log k)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Crudely, the coarse divide-and-conquer phase stops after <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log(k/\lambda)) = O(\log n)\)</span> levels of
recursion, and the total time spent at each level is <span
class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r})(\log^2r + \log n))\)</span> time at
each level. It follows that the overall time for this phase is <span
class="math inline">\(O((n/\sqrt{r})(\log^2r + \log n)\log k) =
O((n/\sqrt{r})\log^3 n)\)</span>, and thus the overall running time of
the overall algorithm is <span class="math display">\[
    O\left(n\log r + \frac{n}{\sqrt{r}}\log^3 n + n\log \log k\right).
\]</span> Setting <span class="math inline">\(r = \log^6 n\)</span>
gives us a final running time of <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log\log
n)\)</span>. (With more effort, this time bound can be reduced to <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log\log k)\)</span>.)</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.1" id="technical-details"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Technical Details</h3>
<p>The previous high-level description and analysis overlooks several
technical details which are crucial for the efficiency of the algorithm.
Here I’ll give only a brief sketch of the most significant outstanding
issues and how to resolve them.</p>
<p>Arguably the most significant detail is that the pieces of the <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-division do not respect the slab
boundaries. The the running time of the query phase of FR-Dijkstra
within any slab depends on the <em>total</em> size of all pieces that
intersect that slab, and a single piece could intersect several (or even
<em>all</em>) slabs at any level of recursion. To avoid blowing up the
running time, we must slice pieces (and their underlying collections of
Monge arrays) along the shortest paths we compute. <strong>This can be
done.</strong></p>
<p>Just as in Reif’s algorithm, we stop the course recursion early
whenever any vertex of the dense-distance graph appears on both the
“floor” and “ceiling” paths of a slab. All <span
class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>-to-<span
class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> distances through that slab will be
computed in <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> time in the fine
phase of the algorithm. If we ignore these <em>collapsed</em> slabs,
then at every level of recursion, each boundary vertex appears in at
most two slabs, so the sum over all sub-pieces of the number of boundary
nodes in that sub-piece is in fact <span
class="math inline">\(O(n/\sqrt{r})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another important technical detail is that after the coarse phase
ends, we need to translate the shortest paths in the dense-distance
graph into explicit shortest paths in <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. In particular, we need to
translate each boundary-to-boundary <em>distance</em> within a single
piece, as computed by MSSP, into an explicit boundary-to-boundary
<em>path</em>. If we record the execution of the MSSP algorithm as a
persistent data structure, we can extract the last edge of the shortest
path from any boundary node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to
any internal node <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log\log\deg(v))\)</span> time. Thus, a shortest
path consisting of <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> edges can
be extracted in <span class="math inline">\(O(\ell\log\log n)\)</span>
time. If we assume (as Italiano et al. do) that</p>
<p>These <span class="math inline">\(O(k/\log k)\)</span> shortest paths
in <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> can overlap; in the worst
case, the sum of their complexities is <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega(nk/\log k)\)</span>. The union of these
<span class="math inline">\(O(k/\log k)\)</span> shortest paths is a
forest <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>; Italiano et al. describe
how to compute <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log\log n)\)</span> time.</p>
<p>Finally, at the beginning of the fine phase of the algorithm, suppose
the floor <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and ceiling <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of some slab coincide. We can
compute the endpoints <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of the shared path <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\cap\beta\)</span> by performing
least-common-ancestor queries in the forest <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Then every <span
class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>-to-<span
class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> shortest path in that slab consists
of the shortest path from <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the unique path in <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and the shortest path from <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>. Thus, we can compute all <span
class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>-to-<span
class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> distances in that slab in linear
time, by computing shortest path trees at <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
