<h1 data-number="1" id="tuttes-spring-embedding-theorembeta"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Tutte’s Spring Embedding
Theorem<span class="math inline">\(^\beta\)</span></h1>
<p>In 1963, William Tutte published a paper ambitiously entitled “How to
Draw a Graph”. Let <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> be any
planar embedding of any simple planar graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nail the vertices of the outer face of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> to the vertices of an arbitrary
strictly convex polygon <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in the
plane, in cyclic order.</li>
<li>Build the edges of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> out of
springs or rubber bands.</li>
<li>Let go!</li>
</ul>
<p>Tutte proved that if the input graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is sufficiently well-connected, then
this physical system converges to a <em>strictly convex</em> planar
embedding of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>!</p>
<p>Let me state the parameters of the theorem more precisely, in
slightly more generality than Tutte did.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> A
<em>Tutte drawing</em> of a planar graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is described by a <em>position</em>
function <span class="math inline">\(p\colon V\to \mathbb{R}^2\)</span>
mapping the vertices to points in the plane, subject to the two
conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The vertices of the outer face <span
class="math inline">\(f_\infty\)</span> of some planar embedding of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> are mapped to the vertices of a
strictly convex polygon in cyclic order. In particular, the boundary of
<span class="math inline">\(F_\infty\)</span> must be a simple
cycle.</li>
<li>Each vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> that is not in
<span class="math inline">\(f_\infty\)</span> maps to a point in the
interior of the convex hull of its neighbors; that is, we have <span
class="math display">\[\sum_{u\mathord\to v} \lambda_{u\mathord\to v}
(p_v - p_u) = 0\]</span> for some positive real coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v}\)</span> on the darts
into <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(I will use subscript notation <span
class="math inline">\(p_v\)</span> instead of function notation <span
class="math inline">\(p(v)\)</span> throughout this chapter.) The edges
of a Tutte drawing are line segments connecting their endpoints. Let me
emphasize that that the <em>definition</em> of a Tutte drawing does not
require mapping edges to <em>disjoint</em> segments, or even mapping
vertices to <em>distinct</em> points. Moreover, the dart coefficients
are not required to be symmetric; it is possible that <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v} \ne \lambda_{v\mathord\to
u}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is
<em>3-connected</em> if we can delete any two vertices without
disconnecting the graph, or equivalently (by Menger’s theorem) if every
pair of vertices is connected by at least three vertex-disjoint
paths.</p>
<p>Finally, a planar embedding is <em>strictly convex</em> if the
boundary of every face of the embedding is a convex polygon, and no two
edges on any face boundary are collinear.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Tutte’s spring-embedding theorem:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>Every Tutte drawing of a simple 3-connected planar graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a strictly convex straight-line
embedding.</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not hard to see that 3-connectivity is required. If <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has an articulation vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, that is, a vertex whose deleting
leaves a disconnected subgraph, then a Tutte drawing of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can map an entire component of <span
class="math inline">\(G\setminus v\)</span> to the point <span
class="math inline">\(p_v\)</span>. Similarly, if <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has two vertices <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(G\setminus \{u,v\}\)</span> is disconnected, a
Tutte drawing of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can map an
entire component of <span class="math inline">\(G\setminus
\{u,v\}\)</span> to the line segment <span
class="math inline">\(p_up_v\)</span>. In both cases, the Tutte drawing
is not even an embedding, much less a strictly convex embedding.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="outer-face-is-outer"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Outer Face is Outer</h2>
<p>Whitney (1932) proved that every simple 3-connected graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has a unique embedding on the sphere
(up to homeomorphism), or equivalently, a unique planar rotation system.
I will describe Whitney’s proof later in this note. Thus, in every
planar embedding of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the faces
are bounded by the same set of cycles; we can reasonably call these
cycles the <em>faces of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>The definition of a Tutte drawing requires choosing one of the faces
of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to be the outer face <span
class="math inline">\(f_\infty\)</span>. We call the vertices of <span
class="math inline">\(f_\infty\)</span> <em>boundary</em> vertices, and
the remaining vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
<em>interior</em> vertices. Similarly, we call the edges of <span
class="math inline">\(f_\infty\)</span> <em>boundary</em> edges, and the
remaining edges of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
<em>interior</em> edges. This terminology is justified by the following
observation:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Outer face lemma:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<em>In every Tutte drawing of a simple 3-connected planar graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, every interior vertex maps to a point
in the interior of the outer face. In particular, no interior vertex
maps to the same point as a boundary vertex.</em>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
We say that an interior vertex <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>
<em>directly reaches</em> a boundary vertex <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, or symmetrically that <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is <em>directly reachable</em> from
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, if there is a path from <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> using only interior edges.
3-connectivity implies that every interior vertex of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can directly reach at least three
boundary vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>We prove the lemma by applying Gaussian elimination to the system of
linear equations defined by condition (2). Linear system (2) expresses
the position <span class="math inline">\(p_v\)</span> of any vertex
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> as a strict convex combination of
the positions of its neighbors in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, that is, a weighted average where
every neighbor of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has positive
weight. By pivoting on that row, we can remove the variables <span
class="math inline">\(p_v\)</span> from the system.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Such a pivot is equivalent to deleting vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> from the graph and adding new edges
between the neighbors of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, with
appropriate positive coefficients on their darts.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (Of
course the resulting graph may not be planar.) Pivoting out one interior
vertex does not change which boundary vertices are directly reachable
from any other interior vertex. Thus, if we eliminate all but one
interior vertex <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, the remaining
constraint expresses <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> as a strict
convex combination of at least three boundary vertices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The same elimination argument implies that <em>every</em> assignment
of positive dart coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v} &gt; 0\)</span> defines a
<em>unique</em> Tutte drawing; the linear system containing the equation
<span class="math display">\[\sum_{u\mathord\to v} \lambda_{u\mathord\to
v} (p_v - p_u) = 0\]</span> for every interior vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> always has full rank.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2"
id="laplacian-linear-systems-and-energy-minimization"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Laplacian linear systems and
energy minimization</h2>
<p>Tutte’s original formulation required that every interior vertex lie
at the center of mass of its neighbors; this is equivalent to requiring
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v} = 1\)</span> for
every dart <span class="math inline">\(u\mathord\to v\)</span>.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> More generally, the physical
interpretation in terms of springs corresponds to the special case where
dart coefficients are symmetric.</p>
<p>Suppose each edge <span class="math inline">\(uv\)</span> is to a
(first-order linear) spring with spring constant <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_{uv} = \lambda_{u\mathord\to v} =
\lambda_{v\mathord\to u}\)</span>. For any vertex placement <span
class="math inline">\(p \in (\mathbb{R}^2)^V\)</span>, the total
potential energy in the network of springs is <span
class="math display">\[
    \Phi(p) := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{u, v}
                    \omega_{uv} \| p_u - p_v \|^2.
\]</span> If we fix the positions of the outer vertices, <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> becomes a strictly convex<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> function of the interior vertex
coordinates. If we let the interior vertex positions vary, the network
of springs will come to rest at a configuration with locally minimal
potential energy. The unique minimum of <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> can be computed by setting the
gradient of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> to the zero vector
and solving for the interior coordinates; thus we recover the original
linear constraints <span class="math display">\[
    \sum_v \omega_{uv} (p_u - p_v) = 0
\]</span> for every interior vertex <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The underlying matrix of this linear
system is called a weighted <em>Laplacian</em> matrix of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. This matrix is positive definite<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and therefore non-singular, so a
unique equilibrium configuration always exists.</p>
<p>When the dart coefficients are not symmetric, this physical intuition
goes out the window; the linear system of balance equations is no longer
the gradient of a convex function. Nevertheless, as we’ve already
argued, any choice of positive coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v}\)</span> corresponds to a
unique straight-line drawing of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.
None of the actual proof of Tutte’s theorem relies on any special
properties of the coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v}\)</span> other than
positivity.</p>
<p>Given the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the outer
convex polygon, and the dart coefficients, we can compute the
corresponding vertex positions in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> time via Gaussian elimination.
(There are faster algorithms to solve this linear system. In particular,
a numerically approximate solution can be computed in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\log n)\)</span> time in theory, or in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n\,\text{poly}\!\log n)\)</span> time in
practice.)</p>

<p>For the rest of this note, fix a simple 3-connected planar graph
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and a Tutte drawing <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. At the risk of confusing the reader, I
will generally not distinguish between features of the abstract graph
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (vertices, edges, faces, cycles,
paths, and so on) and their images under the Tutte drawing (points, line
segments, polygons, polygonal chains, and so on). For example, an
<em>edge</em> of the Tutte drawing <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the (possibly degenerate) line
segment between the images of the endpoints of an edge of <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, and a <em>face</em> of the Tutte
drawing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the (not necessarily
simple) polygon whose vertices are the images of the vertices of a face
of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in cyclic order.</p>

<dt><strong>Proof:</strong></dt>
<dd>
Without loss of generality, assume that <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the halfplane above the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. Let <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be any vertex with maximum <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate; the outer face lemma
implies that <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is a boundary
vertex. I claim that for any vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\in
H\)</span>, there is a directed path in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, where the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinates never decrease. There are
two cases to consider:
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> have the same <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate, the outer-face lemma
implies that either <span class="math inline">\(t=u\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(tu\)</span> is an edge of the outer face. In
either case the claim is trivial.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> must lie below
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> be the set of all vertices reachable
from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> along horizontal edges of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Because <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected, some vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\in U\)</span> has a neighbor that is not in

that <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has a neighbor <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> that has larger <span

there is a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-monotone path in <span

<span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> has <span

Call a point <em>generic</em> if it does not lie in the image of the

through any vertex in the drawing. The split faces lemma implies that
whenever the moving point crosses an edge <span

When the moving point reaches infinity, it is only in the outer face.
Thus, every generic point lies in exactly one face.

<p>For the sake of argument, suppose two edges <span

any generic point near the intersection <span

faces, which we just showed is impossible. We conclude that the Tutte
drawing is an embedding; in particular, every face is a simple polygon.
We already proved that every face in this embedding is strictly convex.

class="math inline">\(d&#39;\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\textsf{succ}&#39;(d) = \textsc{succ}(d)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{succ}&#39;(d&#39;)\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(\textsf{succ}^{-1}(d&#39;)\)</span>. In
other words, suppose the dart order around <span class="math inline">\(v
= \textsf{head}(d)\)</span> is the same in both embeddings, but the dart
order around <span class="math inline">\(w = \textsf{head}(d)\)</span>
is reversed from one embedding to the other. Without loss of generality,
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> are adjacent, and we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(d = v\mathord\to w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(d&#39; = \textsf{rev}(d) = w\mathord\to
v\)</span>.</p>

<dd>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> be the cycles in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that bound faces <span
class="math inline">\(f = \textsf{left}&#39;(d) =
\textsf{right}&#39;(d&#39;)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f&#39; = \textsf{left}&#39;(d&#39;) =
\textsf{right}&#39;(d)\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma&#39;\)</span>, respectively. After an
arbitrarily small perturbation, the images of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> in the polyhedral embedding <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> cross each other at the midpoint
<span class="math inline">\(vw\)</span>, and therefore share at least
one other vertex <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. It follows that
the faces <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f&#39;\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma&#39;\)</span> have disconnected
intersection, and therefore <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma&#39;\)</span> is not polyhedral. <span
class="math inline">\(\qquad\square\)</span></p>

<p>Together, the previous lemmas now imply Whitney’s unique-embedding
theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Whitney):</strong> <em>Every 3-connected planar
graph has a unique planar embedding (up to homeomorphism), which is
polyhedral.</em></p>
<p>In light of Whitney’s observation, Tutte’s spring-embedding theorem
immediately implies the following corollary:</p>
<p><strong>Convex Embedding Theorem:</strong> <em>For every polyhedral
planar embedding, there is an equivalent strictly convex
embedding.</em></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The formulation and proof of Tutte’s theorem that I’m
presenting here follows a lecture note by Dan Spielman (2018), which is
based on papers by Michael Floater (1997); László Lovász (1999); Steven

<li id="fn2"><p>This modification is called a <em>star-mesh

<li id="fn3"><p>It is sometimes more convenient to formalize Tutte’s
description as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{u\mathord\to v} =
1/\deg(v)\)</span>, so that the weights of all darts into each vertex
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> sum to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. This formalization is inconsistent
with the physical spring analogy, but instead treats weights as
transition probabilities of a (backward) random walk. Both
formalizations lead to the same Tutte drawing.<a href="#fnref3"
